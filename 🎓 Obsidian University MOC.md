Welcome to Obsidian University! 

This will serve as your hub for all of the lesson inside the course. 

This is where you will:
- *Reignite your childhood curiosity and love for learning again.*
- *Create a systemized process for learning and studying* 
- *Learn the best mindsets, methods, and tools (Obsidian üòâ) to optimize your learning*

## Before You Start
Some lessons will be more reading based and some will be more application based. 

The bottoms of lessons will have links to a response page with action items for you to complete. Here are three quick action items you can complete right for some quick wins:

**üéäCongratulations!üéä**

**You just finished your first four tasks inside of Obsidian University!**

In addition, the bottoms of lessons will have response action items with questions that look like this:

> [!Question] 
> What is the meaning of life? I know, getting right into the deep questions ü§™

We HIGHLY encourage you to share your answers to these questions in the appropriate discord channels (`#üç™preface-course-chat`, `#‚ö°section1-course-chat`, or `#üåüsection2-course-chat`) to get more involved with the community and  share your learnings with everyone else.

Every time you complete a lesson as well as the relevant action items you can check off its box to show your progress.

**Make sure to do the action items.**

There is a difference between knowing and doing. The action items will help you implement what you learn throughout the course.

For more actionable things, there will usually be buttons you can press to perform certain actions.

## Course Structure
The course is broken up into three main sections which are each broken up into 
modules that are further broken into individual lessons. 

While it's completely up to you how you navigate the course, **I highly recommend you follow the set course structure, especially if your a beginner.** Obsidian while awesome, can have a steep learning curve. We have set the course up in a way to lessen this learning curve but there still will be some inevitable friction at the start. 

Don't make it harder by skipping around if you aren't ready.

The rest of this page has the course itself. 

If you are confident you can delete everything up above leaving only the course itself below. That way everytime you come back to this main page you won't have to scroll all the way down.

**Good luck and happy notetaking!** 

Welcome to the new student era.
