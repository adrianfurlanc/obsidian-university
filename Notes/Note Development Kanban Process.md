-   Kanban for reviewing templates and choosing best practices for them to follow

	-   backlog, in progress (first one to work on it), reviewed by aidan, reviewed by john, finished
## Kanban Lists
See [[Note Development Kanban]]
- Backlog

- In progress
	- Currently writing
	- Can jump to review if you need advice on a certain topic
- Review
	- Sent to the other person
	- Before moving something to review, add comments at the top for any focus points or questions you want advice or critique on
- Amend
	- Looking at someone's suggestions or changes
- Finished
	- Duh
## Process
More responsibility on the creator of the module to dictate the overall structure and cohesion of these notes
- Could have a kanban for the modules themselves if needed

What if one of the topic notes gets branched out into smaller notes?
- I suggest to just outline it in the card, have a bullet for the additional new notes you want to also review
	- Feedback will be put under the main note just for convenience

When starting to work on vault, look at `Review` list to make sure the other person isn't getting blocked by waiting for feedback
- If there is miniscule feedback, we can leave it in comments at the top of the note
- If there needs more synchronous discussion, create a discord thread for it
	- Same name as the main note of the kanban card [[]]
