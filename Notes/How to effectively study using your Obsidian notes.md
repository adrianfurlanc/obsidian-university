There are two ways to create flashcards out of your notes.
## [[Spaced Repetition Plugin]]
```button
name Spaced Repetition: Review flashcards from all notes
type command
action Spaced Repetition: Review flashcards from all notes
```
^button-h87u

When you flip a card, you can choose when you want it to be added back into the review deck based on how well you remembered it.

This helps you see easier cards less, giving you more time to focus on the challenging ones.
## Question Headers
But sometimes, you may not want the formatting required for these flashcards to work, and just want to study by reading the notes you've made.

Re-reading isn't actually that effective for learning, so we need to actively try to recall the information with little cues.

Instead, it's important to have a hierarchical [[Markdown]] structure to your notes using headers and bullet lists (you can even use a note like [[Retrospective Timetables]] as an example!)

So, when you do open your note, you can use the command
```button
name Fold all headings and lists
type command
action Fold all headings and lists
```
^button-16i1

to hide all the content and use the bigger headers and parent lists as cues to remember the rest of the content.
