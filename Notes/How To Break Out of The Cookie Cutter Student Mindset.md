In the last lesson we learned why the future belongs to the new era student, the student that can not only learn fast but loves learning for the sake of learning in itself and differentiates themselves from other students. Then we learned what the Zettelkasten is and started your first one in Obsidian. Today we are going to learn the 5 must have mindsets for building a Zettelkasten in Obsidian.

One day during my Junior year of high school I was wandering around my basement in sadness. 

Suddenly, a video from Ali Abdaal popped up in my recommended. It was a review of an online cohort course called Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte. Ali described the main learnings he took away from the course including mindsets and workflows. 

Out of the entire video, two things intrigued me most:
1. He explained that by building a second brain, a digital, externalized, central repository for the ideas that resonate with you and the resources from which they come from, you can make your past self work for you. **Your past work becomes the building block of future projects allowing your knowledge to experience a beautiful compounding effect.** It's like having a personal butler for your brain.
2. He described building a second brain like a game, a game in learning the best way to capture, organize, distill, and express knowledge in the way that makes most sense to you.

By the time I finished the video I was standing completely still, jaw open. What Ali was describing was a game. 

**If there was one thing I knew then, it's that I love games.** 

This led me down my path in PKM today and eventually to discovering Obsidian and creating what I and John call [[Conceptual Notemaking]]. 

We will go much further into conceptual notemaking during the second part of the course but here it is in sum.

[[Conceptual Notemaking]] is a form [[Notemaking]]--a term coined by fellow PKMer [Nick Milo](https://www.youtube.com/@linkingyourthinking)--which involves taking notes in ones own words. It uses concepts as the fundamental unit of knowledge management. Instead of notetaking predominantly through sequential format on exactly what the professor says, you take notes on individual concepts and *link them together.*

This brings us to one of the most important points of this course. If you take nothing else, take this.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **There are no rigid disciplines in the universe, only concepts.**

Biology, Anthropology, Statistics, History, Phycology (the study of Algae, not joking), etc. They are disciplines that all take highly related concepts and connect them together.

But there's nothing stopping you from connecting a note from Biology to one on History. For example, a note on how the historical Royal English practice of incest led to the famous "long chin" because inbreeding has a higher chance of negative recessive traits revealing themselves. In traditional notetaking the Royal English Family line would probably be an isolated note taken during a history lecture. But with conceptual notemaking we can link it together with the concept of recessive traits from biology to come up with a hilarious insight.

Conceptual notemaking helps fight the three insidious effects from being a Cookie Cutter Student mentioned earlier. 

1. It makes you more engaged in your learning. You add your own unique personality, background, flare, spunk, whatever you want to call it into your notes. Your knowledge is unique compared to other students. You add your own unique sauce to your burger.
2. It lessons the need for incessant studying. The brain doesn't learn by siloing information into rigid folders. It learns through connecting new information to past. Emulating this process using conceptual notemaking means you learn the material better the first time.
3. You never have to start from scratch again. Your notes will start to connect class to class, semester to semester. Instead of starting with a blank slate each semester, your knowledge will compound on itself. 

Through adopting conceptual notemaking into my life, I wake up every day with a wonder and curiosity for what new things I will learn. My video game addiction is no longer an issue. 

**Real life has become the most fun game imaginable.** 

School comprises only a small portion of our lives. The fact is we need to learn how to learn and how to enjoy learning so we can continue to do so for the rest of our adult lives. School can teach you how to succeed in the default path, but learning how to take great notes will teach you how to learn and how to enjoy learning so that you can learn the skills that will be required of you in the digital economy.

**Learning how to learn is the most important skill of the 21st century.**

So you know the importance of breaking out of the Cookie Cutter Student Mindset. But what  mindsets should you replace it with? 

In the next lesson we will dive into the 5 mindsets you should ingrain to be successful in your learning journey.
