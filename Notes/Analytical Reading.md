Analytical reading is where we start to get to the real good stuff. The cream on the crop. The strawberry shortcake after dinner.

In this level we start to come at an author's words by interpreting it through our own experiences and the lens we have. Of course, we do this unconsciously all the time but in this reading level we do so consciously. This approach is very common when a researcher analyzes a piece of literature with a theoretical framework or conducts a literature review with a previous research question. 

Adler explains that there are four essential questions you must find out of any piece of information you want to read analytically: 
1. What is it about as a whole?
2. What is being said in detail and how? 
3. Is it true, in whole or in part? 
4. What of it?

These are the types of questions that reading analytically helps you to answer. To do this, Adler brings up a set of rules to follow while analytically reading to serve as a guide to answering these questions.

## The Questions Of Analytical Reading

### What Is It About As A Whole? 

The first question you must ask is what the information is about as a whole. It's helpful in answering this to know what type of information you are reading. Like said beforehand, different types of information and they promote entirely different types of reading. The way you read some chapters for your math or science class will be completely different from how you read a novel.

There are two broad types of information:
1. Expository 
2. Imaginative

Expository information primarily convey knowledge through theories, opinions, hypotheses, or speculations. This includes works that range from math/science to philosophy and history. Imaginative works try to convey emotions and experiences through some narrative. This includes works like novels, poems, plays, or fiction. Expository information are split into two more categories: Theoretical or Practical.

Adler describes theoretical information as information that teach you that something is the case. Practical information, however, teach you what to do with the knowledge of theoretical works.

A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, a information that describes the history of the universe and modern astrophysics, is purely theoretical as it doesn't point you to do anything with the information it discusses. Except opening you to thinking about the sheer meaningless of your existence on this planet and the ever fleeting nature of all life.

Wow, that got dark fast...

Wahoo! Everything is better with Mario. 

However, how-to information like How to Read (so meta) or opinionated information of any sort are all practical as they either directly or indirectly point you to do something differently in your behaviors.

Adler points out that the first and easiest way to start making these distinctions is by analyzing the information's title. It seems obvious, I know, but many people forget to start with this critical step. Tell me what the title of Charles Darwin's famous information on evolution is called. It's not unlikely that you said The Origin of The Species. The actual title, however, is The Origin of Species. 

The difference is astronomical.

The first tile would imply an exploration of the evolution of just the human species, whereas the second would allude to an exploration of species as a whole. 

**By analyzing the title you can usually differentiate expository from imaginative, theoretical from practical, and if it's historical, scientific, or philosophical.** 

Historical information typically have the word history in the title or allude to something in the past. If you can't tell from the title, they usually convey a feeling of narrative throughout the information, much like in many imaginative literature pieces. 

Differentiating between science and philosophy can be done with a simple rule: If theoretical or practical information deals with things outside of your typical daily experience, you're probably dealing with scientific information. This is because scientific information include information that you can only reproduce in a laboratory.

Once you have figured out what type of information it is, you can begin [[Inspectional Reading]] to uncover if it's worth reading as well as get an idea for its structure.

The culmination of this process is you should be able to give a brief summary of the information in as little as two to three sentences.

### What Is Being Said In Detail And How?

Once you have figured out what the information is about as a whole, you can move on to what is being said in detail and how.

The most straightforward way to do this is to find out what the author's problems are. **If you can figure out what questions the author poses in a piece of information, you can reasonably assume the work will contain the answers somewhere inside.**

Usually these questions will be posed at the beginnings of a work and inside the major structure of the information like the beginning of chapters and paragraphs. Your goal is to analyze the author's problems and how they use their structure to convey the overall message of the information. 

In order to do this you must come to terms with the author. A term is simply an unambiguous word. There are many words in the English language that have multiple meanings based on when you use them.

If you don't come to terms with the author, you will be unable to interpret exactly what they are trying to say. Reading is a discussion between the reader and the author. If you don't have the same definitions for the terms used, you can't have a good discussion. Imagine trying to argue with someone over the best anime whose definition of anime is "art made only in Korea". Wouldn't be fun.

So how do we find those words while reading through information? The significant rule of coming to terms with the author is to find the essential words for the author and then determine the specific meaning of those words.

One easy way to do this is to mark the words that trouble you. You can also look for stresses that the author puts on certain words and not others. They may use quotation marks, italics, or even bold to signify the important words. Even better, they might straight up state the importance or specific meaning of a word they will be using in the text. Unfortunately, once you have found the words, there is no other way to determine what they mean other than using the context of the rest of the paragraph or using a dictionary.

### Is It True In Whole Or In Part?

The third question of analytical reading is is it true in whole or in part? 

We did all of these previous steps because criticizing information requires that you first understand the author. **You will likely let your own biases and beliefs shine through if you don't.**

There four things you can say about an author pointing to the work being false:
-   The author is uninformed.
-   The author is misinformed.
-   The author is illogical.
-   The analysis is incomplete.

The author being uninformed means they don't have all the information necessary to give a comprehensive analysis.

The author being misinformed means they said some things that weren't true. 

The author being illogical means they didn't form a logical argument with their information.

The authors analysis being incomplete means they didn't finish or answer everything they promised at the start of the information.

If you can't find one of these four things to attack a piece of information for, there is no other option but to agree. You can't say, I see nothing wrong with your argument but still think you are wrong. 

### What Of It?

Finally, the last and most important question, what of it? What was the point of reading the information? What value does it give you or the world.

This will be highly subjective but one of the metrics I use to judge if a piece of information is important to me is if it helps my values in any way as well as if I will create something out of it. It's not worth reading something that doesn't do either of those two things.

If you can learn to read analytically, you are above 99.9% of readers when it comes to reading skill. Your comprehension of texts will be leaps and bounds above an elementary or inspectional reader which unfortunately, are the levels most people stay at today. You will develop a much deeper understanding of the things you learn in your classes and dominate any discussion section you are in.

I'm thankful to say that my mom has fostered an ability to analytically read. She hasn't read Make it Stick again, but I'm sure if she did, she would remember it this time.

That said, there is still one more level to reading that, if mastered, will lead to insights you couldn't fathom, [[Synoptical Reading]].
