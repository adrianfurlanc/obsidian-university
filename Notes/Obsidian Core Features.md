## Preface
Now that Aidan's inspired us all, it's time to use the app!

With all the plugins and resources available, Obsidian has countless features, but figuring out where to start can be overwhelming.

Luckily, we can turn to the Pareto Principle, which states that roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes.

In this case, 80% of the fantastic things you want to do in Obsidian will only require learning 20% of its features.

You can learn the other 20% later ;)

## Creating Notes

If you want to create basic notes, you can watch this shortÂ [video guide](https://youtu.be/jAPn6yqrDxQ?t=142)

-   Using sidebar UI
-   Command
-   Quick switcher

But one of the benefits of Obsidian is using templates to create your different kinds of notes (lectures, courses), to which we can use the [[QuickAdd Plugin]]

## Organizing Notes

### Using folders
There are two ways available for viewing notes in folders:
`File Tree` community plugin
- More compact
```button
name File Tree Alternative Plugin: Open File Tree View
type command
action File Tree Alternative Plugin: Open File Tree View
```
^button-rrw7
Default file explorer
- The traditional view
```button
name Files: Show file explorer
type command
action Files: Show file explorer
```
^button-88ua

The vault partially follows Nick Milo's ACCESS folder structure, and the most important folders to know are:
- Atlas
	- Where maps of content reside to navigate your notes
- Calendar
	- Daily and weekly notes
- Cards
	- Concepts and atomic notes
- Extras
	- Templates, images, and other extra goodies
- Spaces
	- Where most school stuff is stored
### Using Tags
Typing a tag in a note like `#tag` will let you 
## Searching Notes
### Search Pane
Use the search pane to have more freedom in finding notes, like searching based on:
- title
- tag
- line

Just click on the search bar while it's empty and you'll see your options:
```button
name Search: Search in all files
type command
action Search: Search in all files
```
^button-d0z9

When searching for something in the quick switcher, you can also see similarly spelt words or phrases thanks to fuzzy search.

For example, try searching up `Obsdn` in quick switcher, and you will see that search results for `Obsidian` still show.
### Quick Switcher
- To quickly open new notes
- Ones that show upon load are your most recently opened
- Can also create new notes by pressing Shift + Enter if the searched text doesn't already exist
```button
name Quick switcher: Open quick switcher
type command
action Quick switcher: Open quick switcher
```
^button-vx3zs
## Command Palette
If you don't know the hotkey to a command, you can open up the command palette `(Ctrl/Cmd+P)` and type it in
```button
name Command palette: Open command palette
type command
action Command palette: Open command palette
```
^button-i7pd

If you were to open command palette and search for the command above (ironic I know), you would be able to find it ðŸ¤ª
## Layout
### Tabs
Much like Google Chrome, you can open different notes in different tabs, which are then grouped into one pane.

You can view tabs in two ways:
- Traditional viewing (how you are right now)
- Sliding panes mode

*Disclaimer: You must have two tabs open in the same group to see the difference in views*
```button
name Toggle stacked tabs
type command
action Toggle stacked tabs
```
^button-gb2n

If you opened a new note and go back to one you were previously on, you can use `Ctrl+Alt+â¬…`
### Sidebar
You can add notes or plugin views into the sidebar for quick access by dragging and dropping them around.

Right now they're sectioned off into two sections each:

Top left
- Starred notes
- Recently viewed notes
- Spaces (might cause lag if you keep it on this page)

Bottom left
- Search
- File explorer
- File Tree Alternative plugin view
- Tags

Top right
- Context explorer
	- For changing metadata
- Strange new worlds
- Backlinks
- Outgoing links
- Local graph view

Bottom right
- Calendar
- Outline of the current note
