*The video version of this lesson is up above. I highly recommend you watch the video version rather than just stick to the written version as it's much more in depth.*

How many books have you read in the moment and thought, "oh my god this is the best book I have ever read in my entire life" only to forget the main points of the book a couple months later. 

The problem is the insights you take from books isn't being connected to past knowledge. It's isolated. In this lesson, I'm going to show you how I use Obsidian to integrate the knowledge I learn from my books into my past knowledge. 

**You can use this same process to connect notes on articles, videos, etc as well.**

It's important you learn how to do this process for yourself because the new era student doesn't just care about learning in school. They are deeply invested in learning for the sake of learning in itself. This makes it essential you are able to work with any sort of information outside of school.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The steps outlined below are simply meant to prime you for the video up above as there is truly no better way to show you how to do this than through video format.

### Step 1: Read The Book

The first step is of course reading the book, article, or watching the video and taking initial highlights or notes either inside of Obisidian or outside and have them connect to Obsidian using some outside integration software like Readwise.

### Step 2: Summarize The Book And Fill Out Main Book Notes Template

Step 2 is to summarize the the book in your own words and fill out the main book notes template which looks like this:

## üöÄThe Book in 3 Sentences
- 
### üé® Impressions
- 
### üìñWho Should Read It?
- 
### ‚òòÔ∏è How the Book Changed Me
- 
### ‚úçÔ∏è My Top 3 Quotes
- 



### Step 3: Consolidate Main Points Into Concept Notes And Link Out To Other Atomic Notes
Step 3 is to create concept notes out of the most insightful and thought provoking ideas from the book summarization process.

Just like with lecture notes talked about previously, this is where the true power of Obsidian comes in. It's the creation of concept notes, connecting them together, and scaling them from semester to semester that your knowledge base becomes more than the sum of its parts. 

**It grows into something greater than the sum of its parts.**

### Step 4: Create Visual Representation Of The Books Ideas
This step is optional but creating visual representations of ideas makes them vastly more memorable. 

Humans have much better memory for visuals than words. In addition, the act of changing the modality of information from writing to a visual means deepens understanding.
