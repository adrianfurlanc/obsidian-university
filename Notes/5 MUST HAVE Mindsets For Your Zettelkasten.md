___

In the last lesson we learned about how I broke out of the Cookie Cutter student mindset by differentiating my knowledge and falling back in love with the process of learning again. In this lesson we will learn the 5 must have mindsets you need to ingrain to succeed in your Zettelkasten.


**If there is one thing that makes you fail to build a Zettelkasten in Obsidian, it's this: you come in with the wrong mindset.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **That's because your mindset ultimately determines how the methods and the tool you learn will work. The methods or tools you use don't matter if you have the wrong mindset.**

I know from experience.

Over my 1000+ hours of learning to take better notes I have gone from Google Drive to Notion to Evernote to Roam Research and finally to Obsidian.

I believed my life would be changed if _I could only find the right tool for me._ But with each and every tool I used I came in with the wrong mindset. I believed the opposite of each of the five mindsets we will discuss shortly.

**As a result I hopped from tool to tool like a addicted video gamer looking for their next big game.**

Let's make sure the same doesn't happen to you. So before we learn the workflow of the Zettelkasten in Obsidian, we will learn the mindsets of the new-era student. To do so, we will explore:

- The New Era Student Pyramid
- The Five Mindsets Of The New Era Student

## The New Era Student Pyramid

The new era student pyramid encapsulates the areas of importance not only when learning to take notes as a student, but for anything in life.

The pyramid shown below is from [​Bianca Pereira's​](https://biancapereira.me/?ref=aidanhelfant.com) Build Your Knowledge Portfolio Course, a course that teaches students how to build a knowledge portfolio, a collection of works--books, blog posts, academic articles, videos, etc.--that how you have the knowledge and expertise you claim you have. [​I highly recommend you check out her course as it has been one of the most influential in my own thinking toward PKM!​](https://biancapereira.gumroad.com/l/prolific-researcher-community?ref=aidanhelfant.com)

Things lower on the period that takes up more space are more important, and things higher on the pyramid taking less space are less.

**Mindset:** the mindset that you bring to your PKM. It will change depending on your goal. Are you trying to create essays out of your notes, study, or something else?

**Methods:** the procedure and workflow you use to go about doing your PKM. For example, Capture, Organize, Distill, Express from Tiago Forte or ARC from Nick Milo. In this article, the method is The Three Cs Of Knowledge Management: collect, connect, create. But there are methods inside of that broader method I will teach as well.

**Tools:** the apps and other things you use to implement your methods and mindset. Next time you struggle using a tool, ask yourself, "Is the tool hard to use, or is it just using a different mindset?

## 5 MUST HAVE Mindsets For Building a Zettelkasten in Obsidian

### 1. Notes Are For Understanding Rather Than For Truth

Seeing notes as truth is a problem for three main reasons:

1. **It keeps people from writing down their thoughts.** Thoughts are unlikely to be true, so people think they shouldn't write them down in the first place.
2. **It doesn't allow notes to evolve.** When you see notes as pieces of truth, there is no reason to go back to them and grow them over time.
3. **Personal notes are seen as disposable.** Because personal notes have your own unpolished thinking, many people see them as trash worthy in comparison to the more fleshed-out work of other researchers and creators whose ideas might also be in their system. _Never devalue your thinking._

New-era students see notes for understanding, representations of their evolving thinking.

This is great for three reasons:

1. **It allows us to avoid perfectionism.** Our notes don't have to be perfect the first time we create them. It's natural to be uncertain when learning something new. We should be confused at points during the learning process!
2. **It allows us to evolve our notes over time.** As we learn more and change our notes change alongside us. Our Zettelkasten becomes a reflection of our changing areas of interest, a reflection of our psychology.
3. **We value our notes more.** Rather than see notes as that boring thing we do during lecture, we start to see them as the core of our learning and creating process.

### 2. Create Concept Notes Over Document Notes

Most students, when they take notes for class--or anything of that matter--create massive document notes.

The issue with document notes is they don't link well. They are too big. Linking a note called Oceanography with a note called Python doesn't create new ideas. The point of linking your knowledge is to create _meaningful new knowledge and to understand old knowledge._

**Linking document-based notes won't foster new understanding and knowledge; it will only create more confusion.**

The solution is to create what is known in the Zettelkasten community as permanent notes, but I have rebranded to call concept notes.

Concept notes are notes that focus on only one idea. This doesn't mean they can't be large. It means **one idea is the focus** of the note, and the other ideas are background contextual or supporting evidence. Because concept notes focus only on one idea, connecting them together creates new meaningful knowledge unlike the document notes most students create.

**It's through this linking together of concept notes that your knowledge connects across classes and scales across semesters.**

This hilights a key idea of the Zettelkasten method of notetaking.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **"There are no rigid disciplines in the universe, only concepts."**

All disciplines — Biology, Neuroanatomy, Behavioral Statistics, American History, etc. — are just highly related concepts linked together into a coherent and more easily digestible form. It's through the linking of these highly related concepts, from class to class from semester to semester, that your knowledge base starts to grow. Your Zettelkasten becomes more than the sum of its individual parts.

### 3. Notetaking Allows You To Clarify Your Thinking

Most students, when they think of notetaking, think of:

- Boredom
- School
- Sadness
- Death

That's so sad, but it's not your fault. The schooling system has taught you to think this way. Most of the time we take notes, we do it in the boring, awful, verbatim style that is so easy to fall into.

As I hope you will realize, the new era student _loves notetaking._

**They love it not only because it's fun and engaging but because it helps them clarify their thoughts in a way they never thought imaginable.**

Thoughts inside the head are jumbled and confused. It's through externalizing them into the world that the new era student gives themself the flexibility to examine and mold ideas into their existing knowledgebase.

### 4. Notetaking Allows You To Compound Your Thinking

Throughout school, we get taught to memorize vast amounts of information to regurgitate it when the testing day comes.

But this doesn't allow our ideas to grow in any way. When you externalize your thinking into notes, you allow your present self to leverage your past self's thinking.

The new era student understands the power notetaking has to compound thinking over semesters and even after college and therefore associates notetaking with joy, exploration, and learning rather than boredom, sadness, school and death.

### 5. You Don't Have To Take Notes On Everything

What!?

Isn't this whole article about taking notes? That's true, but just like taking notes in a misinformed way can cause catastrophe, feeling the need to take notes on everything can become a form of procrastination. Don't turn the act of creating notes out of _every idea in school_ into a chore. That's a recipe for spending tens of hundreds of hours creating notes that not only don't help your understanding but you never use.

Instead, I will explain later on, take notes only on information that isn't USE, unimportant, self-explanatory, or easy enough to memorize on the spot.

Only if I find something that isn't USE do I consider taking notes and distilling what my Professor (I'm talking lectures here) said _in my own words._

**This way, I don't spend countless hours taking useless notes and can spend more of my time enjoying what I'm learning.**

We don't want to turn our second brain into a second internet. We don't need to create a personal Wikipedia. We have actual Wikipedia for that.

By ingraining these five mindsets into my Zettelkasten, I have finally created a Personal Knowledge Management System I am satisfied with.

While I personally use Obsidian as my notetaking tool, and will share some of my methods for using the Zettelkasten in the following lessons, it's really these mindsets that have been the biggest change. I no longer feel the need to hop from tool to tool _looking for the perfect app._

**I understand that mindsets matter more than the methods or tools you use.**


The mindsets you bring to your Zettelkasten matter much more than the methods and tools you use.

5 Must-Have Mindsets For Building A Zettelkasten In Obsidian:
- 1. Notes Are For Understanding Rather Than For Truth
- 2. Create Concept Notes Over Document Notes
- 3. Notetaking Allows You To Clarify Your Thinking
- 4. Notetaking Allows You To Compound Your Thinking
- 5. You Don't Have To Take Notes On Everything

In the next lesson we will explore how everyone has a different thinking style when it comes to Personal Knowledge Management. It's essential we identify yours before going further into the course so that you know what tendencies you have in your notetaking.
