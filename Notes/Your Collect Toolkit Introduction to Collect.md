To connect, study, and eventually create knowledge, we need to have knowledge to do so with in the first place. 

This is what happens during the collect portion of the knowledge process. You collect information from all aspects of your life. Lectures, textbooks, articles, podcasts, YouTube videos, films, television shows, conversations, and more. This provides the foundation of information you use to create new knowledge.

Before John and I got into Personal Knowledge Management, our information diets were terrible. 

I (Aidan) spent upwards of three hours a day on a school night and seven hours over the summer playing video games. And that doesn't even include YouTube. I consumed my share of food reviews, mindless self help content, and anime for hours on end. 

However, after I ingrained these four mindsets to collecting, I started my path to the person I am today. 

Incorporate these four mindsets into your life, and you will be well on your path to starting the collect journey of the knowledge process. 

### üìΩÔ∏èA) Adopt the Mindset of a Curator and Creator

Thoughts and ideas are transient. They will fall through the cracks if you don't collect the important ones. This means collecting must become a habit.

Make these questions a reflex whenever you consume something new:

1.  Does this information resonate with me on an intuitive level?
2.  Does this information reflect my values and curiosities in life?
3.  Does this information have future use?

Stop being a mindless cookie cutter student and adopt the mindset of a curator and creator‚Äîbecome opinionated, objective, and reflective. 

Not everything you hear in lecture or read in your textbook is insightful or even worth collecting. You need to develop the skill of being able to sift what's golden versus what isn't. 

Curators and creators understand¬†[information is like food](https://www.aidanhelfant.com/information-is-like-food/#:~:text=Information%2C%20whether%20digital%20or%20physical,the%20different%20micronutrients%20and%20macronutrients.). Similar to how consistently eating unhealthy processed food like pizza, ice cream, and french fries will make us feel terrible, consistently eating informational garbage will make our thoughts awful. Curators and creators know the quality of their expression depends on the quality of information they collect.

To ingrain their mindset, you should¬†[learn how to create a better information diet](https://www.aidanhelfant.com/how-to-create-a-better-information-diet/)¬†by setting priorities, rules, and regulations for what you consume. collect mostly what resonates and sparks joy while at the same time never flinching from contradictions. These are what foster change and make interesting insights.

The way you prioritize is by following the next three mindsets of collection. 

### üé£B) Create A Collect Toolkit

Your collect toolkit is the specific sources you prioritize collecting information from in your second brain. I find choosing five to six main information mediums and sticking primarily to those is a good number.

As a student some of the mediums in your collect toolkit will be non-negotiable, like textbooks, lectures, and academic articles. But I strongly encourage you to adopt some mediums outside of your schoolwork into your collect toolkit. Things like paper books, anime, YouTube videos, podcasts, and more. I consume mostly lecture content, textbooks, ebooks, articles, and podcasts.

Through continuing to interact with ideas outside of your classes while in school, you keep yourself intellectually curious. You stop yourself from falling into a rigid echo chamber where all you learn about is related to your major. 

One app which I recommend everyone adds to their toolkit is Readwise. Readwise collects highlights and annotations from your mediums of consumption and sends them seamlessly to your notetaking app of choice. I can't describe how much easier this makes collecting information. Obsidian has a fantastic plug in integration with Readwise that makes collecting highlights seamless.

[I have a full video on how readwise works you can check out here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLKChtCSzMQ)

However, as a student I know subscriptions can be tough. So a free alternative you can use is simply to export your Kindle highlights into a book note every single time you finish one. You can also take notes on article or textbooks chapters directly inside Obsidian so you don't have to do any copying of highlights in the first place.

### ‚ûïC) Reduce and Add Friction to Collection

To collect effectively, you have to reduce the friction of capturing in your capture toolkit and¬†add friction¬†to capturing outside of it. For lectures, textbooks, ebooks, articles, and podcasts I make collect seamless by using Readwise. But for other informational mediums, I purposefully increase friction. For example, while using Twitter, I make copy and paste the only methods of collection.

This makes certain only the most actionable and valuable information enters your second brain. It also leaves more time for thinking, the main part of the PKM workflow where you come up with creative solutions to problems.

### ‚ùìD) Create Your Twelve Favorite Questions

"You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large, they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, 'How did he do it? He must be a genius!" - Richard Feynman.

Feynman is one of my idols. He's famous for his teaching skills and Physics discoveries, but above all, he was a great questioner. He even questioned his student's knowledge of basic arithmetic.

He did this through drafting a set of his twelve favorite questions which he filtered through everything he did in life. This made every day an opportunity for him to advance them. It gave immense clarity to what actions he should take in life because he only had to ask, does this further me in one of my questions?

I drafted out my own [[Twelve Favorite Questions]] right here which you can check out for inspiration on drafting your own down below. 

Drafting out these questions will help you immensely with your academics because it will bring clarity into the main thematic questions of your classes. When taking your courses on the day to day, it's easy to get caught in the weeds. Your twelve favorite questions help you see the bigger picture. You start to see how a piece of information you learned during the first day of class relates to a piece of information you are learning halfway through. Plus you keep yourself interested in learning outside of class.

## TL;DR

The best notetakers are intentional with how they collect information.

They adopt the mindset of a curator and creator, create a collect toolkit, and 12 favorite questions they run all information they come across in their life through.

**They see information like food.**

In the next lesson we will learn the different type of notes you can collect inside of your Zettelkasten.
