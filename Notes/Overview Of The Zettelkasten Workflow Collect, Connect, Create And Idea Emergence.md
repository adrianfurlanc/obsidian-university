We are finally getting into the workflow of using our Zettelkasten!

Exciting! 

First let's start with an overview of what we are going to be exploring in the next few modules. 

The Zettelkasten workflow comprises two core processes, collect, connect, create, and idea emergence.

You can think of collect, connect, create, as the horizontal ideation process and idea emergence as the vertical ideation process. Together they will supercharge your notetaking to unimaginable levels. Today we will learn about the horizontal process, collect, connect, create.

Call it the creative process, the knowledge process whatever you want.

The idea is the same.

**You collect information that resonates with you over time, connect it to old information, and than create things out of it.** Over the next four modules we will be doing a deep dive into each of the workflows. 

Let's go!
