Howdy there learners! 

Welcome to Obsidian University. 

Our goal is to break students out of the cookie-cutter mindset, the mindset that school is simply a matter of copying what the Professor says verbatim and gaming the system. School should be a time to effectively explore curiosities and have fun.

As you will soon learn, John and I used to be addicted to video games and were disenchanted with our schoolwork. 

But through implementing the mindsets, methods, and tools talked about in this course, we learned to reignite our childhood curiosity.

Let's get an overview of what you are going to learn in this course: 

### Preface: The Mindset You Need To Break To Succeed In The New Student Era

### Obsidian 101: A Beginners Guide To Supercharging Your Learning With Obsidian

### The Three Step Process To Building A Unique Knowledgebase: Collect, Connect, Create

By the end of this course you will have a concrete system in Obsidian to capture, connect, create, and study your learnings from school and outside school. Hopefully just like us, your schoolwork will be something that instills joy in your life rather than take it away.

### How Can You Succeed With This Course?
To succeed in this course there are a few things I suggest you do:
- Work on Obsidian University for **at least four hours each week** (think of it like a small University course in itself). Research inside of Atomic Habits by James Clear shows that you are significantly more likely to do this if you set an implementation intention, a time and place for when you will do X thing. So go into your calendar and block off the hours for which you intend to go through the course.
- **DO THE ACTION ITEMS!** For the love of all that is peanut butter ðŸ¥œ do the action items. Understanding is not the same as doing. At the end of every single section lesson in the course there are action items afterward. You might think, *ehhhh, I get this I don't have to do the action items.* Out of all the 15+ online courses I have taken I have **never** regretted doing the action items after the course.
- **See this course as an investment into your future.** Learning to take great notes isn't just a tool for University, it's a tool that will help you all throughout life immeasurably. School will teach you how to succeed on the default path. But it won't teach you how to LEARN and it certainly in most majors won't teach you to to MAKE MONEY in the digital economy. Learning to take good notes can give you the skills to do this.

Once you have finished with the action items move onto the next lesson in [[Module - Breaking Out Of The Cookie Cutter Student Mindset]].
