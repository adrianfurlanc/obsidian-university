We have gone through how to collect information from books, articles, lectures, and more. But without the connection process, we can't scale our knowledge over time by connecting lecture to lecture, class to class, semester to semester. Or through putting authors in conversation with each other by [[Synoptical Reading]]. 

You probably have a dorm mate who's room is disgusting. They're a hoarder. It's stuffed to the brim with random stuff, most of which they don't use. 

**They are falling for The Collectors Fallacy.** 

If we aren't careful, we can fall for it to inside of our notetaking systems and remain Cookie Cutter Students. The habit of keeping the cycle of research, reading, and knowledge assimilation short is a powerful way to circumvent our innate addiction to gather piles of stuff.

In this module, we will learn how to find old old notes in our systems for connecting. We will also learn how to connect the ideas we have in our system together.
