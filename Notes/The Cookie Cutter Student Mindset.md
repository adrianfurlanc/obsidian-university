**It's not enough to go to school and get a degree anymore.**

Here's the issue: in the digital age, your perspective and ability to learn fast matters more than your rote knowledge. Not only is there more information than ever before, but new information is coming out faster than ever before. Physical colleges can't keep up.

**A physical college degree simply doesn't prepare you for the digital world anymore.**

As AI systems get better and better and more and more tasks get automated, your unique perspective as a human being is becoming increasingly important. We live in a paradox of abundance. The quality of good information is getting higher, while at the same time, the quality of bad information is getting worse.

Your hobbies, skills, abilities, relationships, and so much more combine to form something no other human being has.

The issue is traditional schooling is still built on an industrial-era model. It's trying to make you into the perfect factory worker, sucking away your unique perspective. It's making you a cookie-cutter student, the student who has no love for learning and differs in no significant way from the students around them.

The future belongs to the new era student.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The new era student loves learning for the sake of learning in itself. They can not only learn incredibly fast, but can imbue their own unique perspective into their notes. This differs them from the students around them.**

The question is, how do you make the journey to become a new era student?

That's where this guide comes in.

**I'm going to teach you a system of notetaking that heightens your creativity, speed of learning, makes your knowledge irreplaceable, all why making school more enjoyable.**

You don't need to be a genius.

As you will see, maintaining this system can take just 15-30 minutes daily.
### Who Is This Guide For?

_Anyone who has experienced these problems:_

- Do you feel there is an **overwhelming amount of information**, and you don't know how to organize it all?
- Do you struggle to synthesize your notes into **meaningful, cohesive knowledge**?
- Are you a **student** looking to learn the **best practices, mindsets, and tools** in Obsidian to supercharge your learning?
- ‚ÄçDo you lack a **systemized process** for notetaking?
- Do you **struggle to find enjoyment** in school learning?
- Do you feel you're not creative?
- Do you start a new semester with **no recollection** of what you learned in the last?

Do any of these sound familiar?

**This is the guide I wish I had from the start of my college experience. If I had started just a year earlier I can't even imagine the value I could have created for myself.**
## Who Am I?

Hi!

I'm Aidan Helfant, a Cornell Student studying psychology and creating content on the side. My fellow course creator John was a computer science major when he was in University.

As kids, we were both addicted to video games and YouTube like a fish is addicted to water.

Every day after school, I would sprint to my room faster than Usain Bolt and boot up the computer. My addiction only became worse during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. My life became a cycle of eating, attending online classes, and playing video games.

I began to wonder what drew me so much to these virtual environments.

The reason was simple.

**The real world didn't provide the carefully designed pleasures, the thrilling challenges, and the powerful social bonding I could get in games.** The real world was serving me plain broccoli, while games were serving me a delicious pizza. In games, I could fully embrace my childhood curiosity and playfulness. I could explore, create, and learn to my heart's content. Compare this to my offline pursuits like school.

In contrast, school had killed my childhood curiosity.

In school, I was forced to do endless tests, essays, quizzes, and homework. **Instead of learning for the sake of learning in itself, I learned to get the best grade on the test.**

But the worst part about school, by far, was the notetaking. Notetaking brought these thoughts to my head:
- Boredom
- Sadness
- Death

Many, many students are in the same boat as me. We all have some sort of passion outside of school. For me, it was gaming. For you, it might be anime, drawing, or, if your aspire to be like Naruto, practicing martial arts. In comparison, **school doesn't provide the same level of engagement we get in our hobbies.**

The next question then became, why?

John and I believe one of the main reasons is students today are becoming what we call cookie-cutter students, the student who has no love for learning and differs in no significant way from the students around them.

Tell me if this sounds familiar, like a bad case of deja-vu: taking notes in class, I would copy exactly what the professor said verbatim. To study for tests later on, I would read my notes passively. For most of my life, I was a cookie-cutter student.

Being a cookie cutter student had three insidious effects.

1. My knowledge base became a cookie cutter version of all the other students taking notes in the same way. There was none of my own authentic personality inside of the notes. I had no stake in my ideas. I didn't care about learning, only about getting the best grade on the next test.
2. Studying dominated my life. In a desperate attempt to achieve an A+ on everything I would have to spend hours studying to make up for my passive studying techniques. It was like trying to climb Mount Everest with flip flops. I lost out on time for exercise, relationships, and eating large large amounts of peanut butter.
3. My learning was siloed from semester to semester. Not only did my notes have none of my authentic touch, but they also didn't connect together from class to class over semester to semester. In effect, every semester was like starting with a blank slate. None of my past work helped me in the future.

**That was until I found the Zettelkasten system of notetaking.**

Building a Zettelkasten allowed me to make the transformation to the New Era Student. I no longer felt the need to play video games. Real life was the most fun game imaginable.

Using my Zettelkasten in Obsidian, I have created all of this in just two years:

- 170 YT videos
- 550 literature notes
- 60 Newsletters
- 60 Blog Posts
- 10 School MOCs
- 15 Non-School MOCs
- 30 Podcast Episodes

What my notes looked like before and after the Zettelkasten transformation:

**Now you can do the same.**

In this course we are going to show you how to build a Zettelkasten in Obsidian yourself by summarizing what we have learned over 100s of hours of experience and reflection, taking multiple courses in the PKM community like Building a Second Brain, Build Your Knowledge Portfolio, and The Linking Your Thinking Workshop. The best part is once the system is set up, all it takes to maintain is a simple 15-30 minute a day check-in.

- Or your nightly shutdown. üåú
- Or your daily peanut butter snack ü•ú
## What is a Zettelkasten?

_"Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it; they just saw something."_ - STEVE JOBS

A Zettelkasten (German for "slip box" or "card index") is a note-taking and knowledge management system developed by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann in the early 20th century.

At its core, a Zettelkasten is a collection of three main types of notes: fleeting notes (notes on fleeing thoughts), literature notes (notes taken from resources like books, articles, etc.), and permanent notes--which I have rebranded as concept notes (notes with one focal idea that often have literature notes backing them up). You don't have to remember these three types of notes now. We will discuss them in depth later. At it's core the Zettelkasten works by using fleeting notes and literature notes to create permanent notes that connect together over months and years forming a knowledgebase that compounds over time.

**Using the system, Luhman was what can only be described as "disgustingly prolific."**

Over the course of his career, Luhmann created an extensive Zettelkasten containing tens of thousands of individual notes and writing 70 books and hundreds of articles and essays.

Holy smokes. üå∂Ô∏è

So how did I break out of the cookie cutter mindset by building a Zettelkasten in Obsidian?

That's what you will learn in the next lesson.
