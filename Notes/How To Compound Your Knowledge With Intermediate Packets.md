Have you ever started a new project invigorated and excited, only to sit down with a blank page having no idea what to do next?

**It‚Äôs frustrating.**

I felt this way for most of my life. Then I learned how to repurpose my past self‚Äôs work for my future self. Now, I never¬†_start from scratch_. I begin most projects at 80% completion without even realizing it. I create more in 2 months than I used to in 2 years.

The secret is through utilizing Intermediate Packets (IPs). 

In this lesson we will discuss:
1. What intermediate packets are?
2. The benefits of creating them
3. How you can create them

### üì¶What Is An Intermediate Packet?

An ‚ÄúIntermediate Packet‚Äù is called so because of the internet. On the internet, information must be compressed to allow it to fit into a tiny tube. This makes its parts small enough to travel the net and exit somewhere else where it‚Äôs uncompressed into its original form.

IPs work in the same way. They are the most actionable and useful parts of past work compressed into building blocks that can be reassembled for future projects. They can be practically anything.

Let's talk about some specific examples in STEM classes:
-  A list of valuable probability equations with fully solved example problems underneath
-  A document full of R statistics code with examples of when to use it
-  A summary note of the Theory of Evolution from Charles Darwin

Here are a few examples of school related IPs I have created:
- [A MOC summarizing the three applications of the Statistical method Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with equations and explanations for me to use while doing homework.](https://publish.obsidian.md/aidanhelfant/Cards/ANOVA)
- [An academic essay on the social effects of an awesome solar eclipse](https://publish.obsidian.md/aidanhelfant/Spaces/College/%E2%9C%92%EF%B8%8FAcademic+Articles/An+Evaluation+of+The+Social+Effects+of+an+Awesome+Solar+Eclipse)
- [A MOC summarizing probability](https://publish.obsidian.md/aidanhelfant/Cards/Probability)

### üí∏The Five Major Benefits Of Creating Intermediate Packets For Students

Utilizing IPs has more advantages than simply saving time. Here are the seven major ones:

1.  **You reduce procrastination**¬†because you rarely have to load an entire project in your head at once. Everything is a work in progress. Since nothing is ever final, there is no need to wait to get started. 
2.  **You can create value in any period.**¬†Ask yourself, ‚Äúwith my time, mood, and energy right now, what is the most valuable IP I can create for school?‚Äù Even five minutes a day adds up over a semester.
3.  **You think bottom-up instead of top-down.**¬†Instead of thinking top-down, asking ‚Äúwhat projects need to get done?‚Äù you can think bottom-up by looking at your IPs and asking, ‚Äúwhat projects am I already 80% done with?‚Äù In this process, everything becomes connected.
4.  **You prepare yourself for inflection points.**¬†IPs prepare you for the cliche ‚Äúonce in a lifetime opportunities.‚Äù You must be ready¬†_before_¬†they come. I was once given a few days to structure and plan out a whole course while applying for my dream job as a course content writer under Ali Abdal. I planned a course on¬†[how to write a comprehensive book summary](https://www.aidanhelfant.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-book-summary-writing/). All I had to do was tap back into my IPs on course creation, my previously written down course ideas and my past writings on how to summarize books. It took me three hours. I struggle to measure the value of these three hours.
5.  **Your IPs become gifts.**¬†A family member is looking for the best restaurants in a city, and you share your starred restaurants in the city with Google maps. Your nephew is looking for a health podcast to listen to, and you share your IPs on the best health podcasts of the year. Soon, your generosity pays back, and other people give you their IPs. You create a serendipity vehicle by crafting your own luck and becoming a magnet to future people and opportunities you never knew existed.

### How Can You Create IPs?
Creating IPs is quiet simple, _**Write Things Down.**_

Through collecting, connecting, and finally creating whether it be through using the Dump, Lump, Jump process, creating games in computer science, or something else, you can create IPs over time. Anything which isn't written down is transient. Your brain is not solely for storing ideas but also for having them. 

**You can‚Äôt leverage past work for creative insight if it doesn‚Äôt exist.**

Many students make the mistake of only having their student work siloed inside their schools learning platform. 

This makes it impossible for them to compound their knowledge across time. I can't emphasize enough how important it is for you to create things out of your class learnings and outside learnings whether it be assignments, projects, essays, or some other type of creation.
