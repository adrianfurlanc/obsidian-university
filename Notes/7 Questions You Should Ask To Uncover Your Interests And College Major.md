**One of the most terrifying decisions every college student has to make is what major they should go down.**

It's insanity. At the age of 18 you are expected to pick what could potentially be the path you go down for the rest of your life. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. I (Aidan) switched majors twice before landing on Psychology.

**The reason so many students struggle with this decision is they don't know themselves well enough.**

Because of this they make one of two big mistakes:
A. They choose the major their parents or society are pushing them to do
B. They choose a major at random and don't switch out when things go sour because "they have to stay commited."

Don't be one of these people.

That's why we need to do what Socrates is famous for saying, "Know Thyself." Getting to know yourself better is one of the best ways to uncover your interests and major in college. 

**Here are 7 questions I wish I had asked myself before coming to college to help me uncover my interests and major.**

At the end of each question I have put a section for you to answer. I encourage you to take your answers and post them inside of `#🍪preface-course-chat`. 

## Question 1: Do I Want To Be A Master Chef Or An Artist?
There are two strategies to uncovering your interests and major at college.
#### Strategy 1: 🧑‍🍳The Master Chef
The first strategy is to be a master chef.

Master chefs refine their interests and major before they ever come to college like how a master chef refines their menu before people come to dine. They analyze the rest of the people in the niche they are interested in and find ways they can differentiate themselves beforehand.

The benefits of this strategy is it provides you with a plan from the get go. You are less likely to waste time taking classes that won't contribute to your major. 

But the major drawback is it takes more time, makes you less likely to explore other intellectual curiosities, and can leave you unwilling to change majors later on because of a need to commit.
#### Strategy 2: 🎨The Artist
The second strategy is to be an artist.

Artists don't know their interests and major but rather craft it over time like a painter creates a painting from a blank canvas. They try a whole bunch of different classes and consume information in a whole bunch of different areas. 

The benefit of this strategy is it takes less planning, and allows you to explore many interests (good for cultivating a love for learning). 

But the major drawback is you will likely take lots of classes that won't contribute towards your major. 

Choose the strategy that resonates more with you from up about.

You are what you eat. Information, whether digital or physical, is food for the brain. It's no accident we call new ideas "food for thought." 

Hopefully writing out this list will give you clarity on what your interests are.

## 💡What Is Your PIERS Framework?

The PIERS Framework stands for:
P - Principles
I - Interests
E - Exception
R - Reluctance
S - Strengths

Figuring out what these things are will give you tremendous insight into what your interests are.

I encourage you to go through and write your answers to the questions for each below taking my answers as inspiration.
##### Principles (P)

What do you care about most in life? What do you spend a lot of time doing? Is there anything that most people agree with, but you take a different stand? What makes you feel that you have a purpose in life? 

###### 🥜My Answer

**I care about helping others reignite their childhood curiosity and transcending the self.** 

Many people love learning from childhood but have the love sucked out of them by the school system. Helping others fall in love with their childhood curiosity is important to me because it makes life an endless reservoir of possible joy. It humbles you. You realize how small you are in comparison to the universe.

This in turn helps you transcend the self.

**Transcending the self stops you from pursuing egoic desires which often hurt others.**

I spend a lot of time creating content helping people learn how to create a Personal Knowledge Management System that helps them reignite their childhood curiosity.

*What do most people agree with I disagree:*
- Happiness is the ultimate life goal
- The default path is safe
- Writing online isn't a viable way to make money
- Getting straight A's is something they should do
- Memorizing is a waste of time
- Atomic notes are a viable way to take notes
- Notes shouldn't connect between classes
- Humor, charisma, and creativity are talents we are born with
- Intelligence is largely genetic

##### Exception (E)

What’s special (or weird) about you? How are you different than most people? Is this quirkiness going to scare some people away?

###### 🥜My Answer

I am unusually positive. I have a deep emotional world under the surface but try and come across positively most of the time because it brings other people up. I have a deep drive to help other people. I can't just sit and rest, it's not my nature.

###### 🫵Your Answer

##### Reluctance (R)

What things don’t come naturally to you or do you have to spend a lot of time doing? What do you not want to associate with your personal brand?

###### 🥜My Answer
Finance related things in the business. I don't associate salesiness with myself. I want to be very approachable. I don't want to come across as too serious.

###### 🫵Your Answer
##### Strengths (S)

What are you good at? Has anyone complimented you on a skill? Have you achieved surprising results in one of your previous projects (projects at work, online projects, or hobby projects)? What does that tell you? Thinking back to your childhood, what did you gravitate towards doing? 

###### 🥜My Answer
I'm good at consistency, authenticity, writing, reading, storytelling, public speaking, Personal Knowledge Management, learning effectively.

###### 🫵Your Answer

Hopefully answering these questions has helped you uncover your interests. 

While I can't advise you which major to pick based off of this I encourage you to meet with a career advisor and use these questions to help guide you in your major decision. 

**Remember, passions are built, rarely found.** 

If you don't feel you are passionate about much yet, that's okay. Pick something. Anything. Your purpose is solving whatever is your biggest problem at the moment. 

Cultivate your passion over time.
