## Themes
You're going to be staring at this screen for potentially hours every day, so it's important to make it something bearable to look at ;).

Luckily, Obsidian lets you customize the layout and appearance of your vault using themes!

If you're a fan of customizing your own theme, then the Minimal Theme is all you need (the current one the vault is using).

There's a comprehensive documentation made on how you can customize different parts of the vault, which you can find https://minimal.guide/Home

If you're not a fan and want to just use an already existing theme, you can find more themes in `Settings > Appearance > Themes > Manage`

Look out though! Choosing themes can be a slippery slope. One moment your innocently looking for a new theme and the next your whole day is sucked into the black hole of what the Obsidian community calls ***theme death.***

Here are some suggestions:
- John uses `80's Neon` during his videos
- After hours of exploring themes, Aidan has chosen to use... the default theme ðŸ˜…
- Nick Milo uses the `Linking Your Thinking` theme
- If you're a fan of Notion you can use the `Notation` theme

## Plugins
