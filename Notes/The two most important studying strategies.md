[[Spaced Repetition]] and [[Active Recall]] are two of the most effective studying strategies, so this module will help you implement both into your Obsidian workflows.

If you don't know already, here's some insight into these study techniques:
- Spaced Repetition is when we spread out our study sessions instead of cramming everything all at once, letting us have longer memory retention due to the [Ebbinghaus forgetting curve](https://www.edapp.com/blog/ebbinghaus-forgetting-curve/)
- Active recall is the process of questioning your knowledge of material through active studying techniques like testing. It prepares us for tests since we have to put in effort to remember the answers based on questions and cues.
