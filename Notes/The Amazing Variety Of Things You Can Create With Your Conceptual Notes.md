**The most valuable habit I ever ingrained in school was public learning.**

Public learning is the act of taking your learning and doing it in public in some way. This could be from creating YouTube videos, podcasts, blog posts, newsletters, etc. This doesn't come naturally to students because we are so used to creating things only for the class.

The problem:

**If we only ever create for the classes we are in we don't build intermediate packets that can be used outside of our classes.**

For the entirety of my school experience, I have been creating content part-time on YT, my newsletter, and my podcast. I want you to start doing the same, in whatever small way you can. I can help you answer the toughest question you will have:

What do you create in the first place?

I created a massive list of all the things you could create using your notes:

1. Novels

51. Curriculum vitae (CV)

This list just hits the ice berg. There are so many other things you could create as well.

How do you figure out what to write about inside of these things? My favorite method is through using the 2 year test.

	Essentially, you ask yourself what problems your 2-year past self had that you have solved now. Than you create content on those things.
