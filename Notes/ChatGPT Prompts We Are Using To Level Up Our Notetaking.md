#### Ideate Connections Using Idea Compass
[[Methods For Growing Concept Notes Summary#The Idea Compass]]
```
I am writing a note titled `note`, and want to use the idea compass methodology to find new ideas to connect it to. 

The idea compass is as follows: imagine the four compass directions. each direction helps give definition to the idea in different ways. 

NORTH: ‚ÄúWhere does X come from?‚Äù what are its origin? what group/category does X belong to? what exists an order of magnitude higher? zoom out. what gave birth to X? what causes X 

WEST: ‚ÄúWhat is similar to X?‚Äù what other disciplines could X already exist in? what other disciplines could benefit from X? what are other ways to say/do X? 

SOUTH: ‚ÄúWhere can X lead to?‚Äù what does X contribute to? what group/category could X be the headline of? what exists an order of magnitude lower? zoom in. what does X nurture? 

EAST: ‚ÄúWhat competes with X?‚Äù what is the opposite of X? what is X missing? its disadvantage? what could supercharge X? Imagine you are linking to other similar wikipedia-style articles that focus on one main idea. These "articles" should be broad and brief in title. What are some possible X links you could make? 

Explain your reason for choice for each link.
