## Importing a Video File
- While importing press options to see video data (type, fps, etc)
- Use the dropdown in options to filter through of video formats
- If I double click the video thumbnails this opens the Video Player

- Another way if importing
	- Right click on track header and select Add Video Track. (I can only have one). Drag de the video to the Video Track to import it.

- The pool (command+p) shows all the resources that the project is using, It has an audio folder, a video folder and a trash
- If the video frame rate is mismatched with to the project frame rate, a red line appears in the thumb lines, explaining the problem.
-  From the pool I can view all the info of the video including fps.

- To change the frame rate or the format (because Cubase can’t play it)

- To convert video files use an app called handbrake
	- Open source (top left)
	- Select the vide file
	- Choose the Fast 1080p30 preset 
	- Choose a folder to convert the file into
	- Click start in the tool bar to start converting


## Adjust Video Display
- Right click on the the Video Player and select a size
- Change size by dragging from the bottom right corner of the Video Player
- In Studio \> Studio Setup \> Video you can show the timecode in the Video Player




## Inserting Multiple Videos on the video track
- A dialog shows up when the video has audio. If I do pull in a video that does have some audio track, Cubase will set audio track with the attached audio of the video.

## Tempo
- The tempo will give to the rhythm of the visual
- Project \> Beat Calculator 
	- This opens up a dialog with the amount of beats, bpm and tap tempo
	- Play the video, got to the Beat Calculator and then tap tempo
	- Check that the tempo is set correctly with using the metronome
- Add a lane to overdub MIDI in an instrument track
- Press monitor in an Audio track to listen to the instrument I’m playing at the same time

## Using Tempo Changes
- Right click on the track head and add Tempo Track
- The first number is the current tempo of the song 
- I can choose the type of changes that I want to occur when I create new points along this Tempo Track
	- Jump
		- When I create a point in my tempo track and adjust it’s going to jump straight from the previous tempo to the next.
		- Click to create a point and move it up and down to change the tempo
	- Ramp
		- First create a jump point, then a ramp point. If I drag the ramp point the tempo changes gradually over time
