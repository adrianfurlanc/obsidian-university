**QuickAdd Explained**

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrQVQ37y6IU)

Summary:: Lets you easily create any new type of note (lecture, course, etc.)
## Principles
For each note, instead of having to create a new note, manually import the template, then move the file over to the right folder, what if you could do that in one simple command?
### Using a Choice

- Each command you see in the QuickAdd command pallete (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) are called choices
- You can select any choice to create a note of that kind, and the input prompt will be used as the title of the note
### Creating a Choice
To create a choice:
1. Go to `Settings` -> `QuickAdd`
	- Put the name of the command you want to create in the input field
	- Set the type to `Template`
	- Click create
	- Set the path of the template
	- Set the folder (make sure to click the checkmark!)
	- (Optional) Enable `Open` and `New Split`
### Modifying a Choice
- To modify the note template selection process, go to QuickAdd settings, `Manage Macros`, and you will see the already existing QuickAdd actions for already existing notes
	- Be sure to disable then re-enable the lightning bolt to update the command!
