Obsidian Bookmarks are an easy way to access the navigation notes in the vault like [[🏠 My Home]], [[My School|🏫 My School Dashboard]], and [[My Courses]].

If you want to add a bookmark, simply run the following command to do so:
```button
name Bookmarks: Bookmark...
type command
action Bookmarks: Bookmark...
```
^button-u0wg

We've provided a basic structure for the most essential notes you may find yourself revisiting, but feel free to customize it for your own needs!

In the courses folder, you can also add your courses for this semester.
