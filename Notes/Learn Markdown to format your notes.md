## Why Markdown?
Obsidian as an application is stored as markdown text files on your computer. Markdown is used in many other note-taking apps, and is a universally known way of formatting and styling your notes. 

By using Markdown, you're making your notes future-proof for if you decide to switch to a different note-taking application, or to at least make it compatible with other ones. In addition, text files are incredibly small meaning Obsidian doesn't take up that much space on your computer.
## How do I use it?
Learn all syntax in Obsidian's [official documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes), or see the most commonly used ones being used in [this video](https://youtu.be/jAPn6yqrDxQ?t=188)

If you're having trouble remembering what syntax is for what, don't worry, as plugins are here to the rescue!

## Plugins
Thanks to its generous community, people have made custom plugins you can install to add more features to Obsidian.

Here is one to make markdown easier:

[[Cmenu Community Plugin]] (not enabled)
- A static menu at the bottom of your screen
- Can add custom commands as well for other formatting options
## Uses
I (John) personally use these different stylings for their traditional use cases:
- Headers and bullet points
	- hierarchically organize information
- **Bold**
	- for key words
- *Italics*
	- for resonating points and emphasis
