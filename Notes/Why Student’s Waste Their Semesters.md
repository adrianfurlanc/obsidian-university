Before integrating a systemized collect, connect, and create process I had a problem. 

A big one. 

I would show up for the next quarter in high school or semester in college and I would have forgotten everything from the previous semester. To make matters worse, I had no easy access to the material from my previous classes. Assignments, homework, and essays was handed in through the schools course management system which was closed off to me after the year.

**I lost hundreds of hours of work...**

This is how students waste their quarters or semesters. They don't have a systemized process for taking their past work and using it for things in the present. And they don't connect their notes between classes and across semesters together. In effect, they have no way to leverage past work and compound a unique knowledge base over time.

The solution is to understand the knowledge process which brings us to the bulk of what the main three next modules will be. Wanna know how long it took me to write this lesson? 

2 minutes.

I just copied and pasted a note I had on a past project in Obsidian that was highly related and than just changed it around slightly.
