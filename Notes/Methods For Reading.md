You just read about the theory of all four of the levels of reading! Now it's time to put theory into action.

In this lesson we are going to go through four reading strategies John and I personally use for practically all of our reading to collect things into our Obsidian notetaking system. 

Here are the methods we will talk about roughly summarized:
1. Quick reading: used when you want to rapidly scan a text for rough idea.
2. Targeted reading: used when you are looking for a specific thing for deeper reading.
3. One pass reading strategy: the method you probably already use. You just read and take notes.
4. Close reading: a more advanced version of the one pass reading strategy used when you want to understand a work more deeply.

Let's go over each.

### Quick Reading
Quick reading is used in the case where you are looking for inspiration, don't have much time, aren't looking for anything in specific, or just want to get a rough idea for what a work is trying to say to see if it's worth a closer read. 

Essentially you just rapidly scan through a text without taking any notes. You want to get the general idea of the text. It's a combination of the two parts of Inspectional reading mentioned before, pre-reading and superficial reading.

### Targeted Reading
Targeted reading is used when you are looking for a specific thing in a text for deeper reading.

You find a specific part of a text that interests you and then you use one of the deeper reading strategies mentioned below. 

### One Pass Reading 
In one pass reading you read through a piece of work from start to finish. That's why it's called one pass...

I couldn't help myself.

As you are reading, you take highlights on passages that inspire you. Then you perform freewriting in an annotation for that passage **when you take the annotation.** It's important that you do it then and there because your mind is filled with information relevant to the passage right then.

What should you write inside of the annotation while freewriting. Apart from anything important that comes to mind you can try to answer the four questions of Analytical reading mentioned before:
1. What is it about as a whole?
2. What is being said in detail and how? 
3. Is it true, in whole or in part? 
4. What of it?

If your reading a text for a discussion class you can think of questions you want to ask other students during the discussion. Or if it's for an essay, you can think of ways to relate the highlight to the essay prompt. 

Once you get better and better at connecting your notes you will even be able to think of notes to create out of highlights that you can tell your future self to do inside of the annotation. Or notes that your future self can connect notes to inside of Obsidian.

### Close Reading
Close reading is a more advanced version of the one pass reading strategy used when you want to understand a work more deeply.

In close reading you read through a work three times using the one pass reading strategy. The first read gives you an idea for what the author is saying holistically. 

Often times between the first and second pass you read more into the context behind the work and get more background information. This gives you more insight into the book when doing your second run through.

In the first and second passes it's okay to make highlights and jot down your thoughts, but you must remember they were made before you might have truly understood the work. Only in the third pass, do you really hunker down on highlighting and freewriting to understand a work on the deepest level.

Now that we have gone through the methods for reading, we can finally move onto how to take lecture notes using Conceptual Notemaking. Check out [[My Step By Step Process For Taking Conceptual Lecture Notes In Obsidian]] to learn more.
