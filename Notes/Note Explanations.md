Remember that all these templates are customizable!

Feel free to modify queries, move around headers, or remove/add your own.

Most of them are self-explanatory or will be explained through Aidan's modules, so I'll only go over some more complicated templates and workflows:

## [[Assignment Template]]
Can be viewed in [[My Assignments]]
### Notes
- Be sure to have a link to the week(s) you work on it or else it will not show in your weekly review
#### Related
- Can manually link to notes if needed if you need to add extra comments, unlike the backlinks view where you can only see the link
#### Related Resources
- External links, input notes, etc
## [[Daily Note Template]]
Can be viewed using [[Calendar Plugin]]

For an example, see [[2023-02-12]]
### Notes
#### Journal
- Anything you would want to see when looking at your weekly review
- A space to unload what's on your mind, whether it be school or personal
### Reflection
#### Summary
- What did you accomplish? How did you feel?

## [[Weekly Review Template]]
See [[Periodic reviews]] for more information

### Future Plan
- You can use this section to clarify what your objectives are (what assignments are due, what topics you need to study), create new schedules for the next week
- Fill this out after you are done recap and reflection
### Recap
- See how your days went and what new things you learned
### Reflection
- Be sure to have some weekly prompts related to conceptual notemaking or the vault just to make sure you're incrementally improving and customizing it to your needs
#### Review
- The different reflection questions can be answered in relation to your studies or life as a whole, whatever works best for you
#### Troubleshooting
- Treat this as time for personal maintenance to make sure you're at your best ðŸ˜Ž
- Some time to think critically about what you've done the past week, and whether there's anything that needs  changing
## [[Lecture Template]]
- Can be viewed in [[My Lectures]]
### Summary
- A summary of the below notes
### Notes
- Can turn your notes into [[How to effectively study using your Obsidian notes#Question Header|question headers]]
## [[Input Template]]
- Can be viewed in [[My Inputs]]
- Similar template structure as Lecture Template
- Be sure to complete the `#i/` tag by noting what kind of input it is, some example ones can include:
	- `#i/article`
	- `#i/video`
	- `#i/paper`
	- `#i/textbook`
## [[Course Template]]
- Can be viewed in [[My Courses]]
### Retrospective Timetable
See [[Retrospective Timetables]]
### Unordered
- Lists all concept notes related to the unit

## [[MOC Template]]
- To prevent duplicate links (manual and automatic via [[Dataview Plugin]]), if you make a link to another note that is already being shown in one of the queries, it will be removed from the query
