If you want a detailed resource, I suggest you read the importance and benefit of using retrospective timetables in Ali's [blog post](https://aliabdaal.com/retrospectiverevisiontimetables/).

Essentially, retrospective timetables help us keep track of how often and how well we are studying different parts of a unit.
### Steps
1. Have a table to list the different topics of study
2. Pick a topic to study for the day
3. Rate the quality of understanding after a session through forms of measurements
	- Can use a 5-star rating ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
	- Can use different colors üî¥ üü† üü° üü¢
## Benefits
- Makes the studying process more adaptable/flexible
- Effective yet easy to understand
	- Visually illustrates topics for further studying
## Practices
### On choosing what to study:
- Consider what topic would help the most if you had to take the test tomorrow
- Prioritize colors first (go for ones that are still low mastery), then you can prioritize dates
### Implementing
A timetable will automatically be created for each [[Unit Template]], which are made using [[Markdown]] tables
- Press tab after adding content to a table cell to properly space it evenly
- To include a new revision, click inside the appropriate cell, type `@@` and choose the `Today` option to leave the timestamp
- Then, add the color/rating depending on your mastery
- To add a new concept, just press enter while on a cell in the last row
- To add a new revision column, just press tab while on the last revision column
