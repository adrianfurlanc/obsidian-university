### Step 1: Dump
- [ ] Dump every idea, quote, or note you think would be relevant to the piece of writing into a note.
### Step 2: Lump
- [ ] Take all of your dumpings--you better thank me for not making a poop joke--and lump them together based on theme. 
### Step 3: Jump
- [ ] Copy and paste the contents inside each note and bring them into your document.

Then, the only thing left to do is write which involves three things:
- [ ] Reword and reframe the note content to fit with the specific work
- [ ] Connecting together what you have into a narrative
- [ ] Finding holes in your argument and identifying areas for further research
