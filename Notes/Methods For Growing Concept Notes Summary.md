### Freewriting
Freewriting involves opening up a new note or existing note and letting your thoughts flow. 

There are many different kinds of freewriting you can use as well depending on what type of spice you are looking for in a certain day:
- Simple Freewriting: Set up a timer and follow the flow of thought without any extra constraints.
- Brain dump Freewriting: This variation is exactly like the simple freewriting, but no timer required.
- Extreme freewriting: like braindump freewriting but there is no stopping or erasing.
- Triggered Freewriting: Use a question or an observation as prompt to kickstart your freewriting process.
- The prompt can be anything:
	-   An idea
	-   A question
	-   Your feelings
	-   Your physical sensations
	-   A situation you want to think about
	-   Something you are currently looking at
- Prompted Freewriting: this is like triggered freewriting but every time you get stuck you come back to the original prompt and ask the question, "what else can I think about?" Just be careful not to come back too soon.

### Summarizing
You summarize the main arguments, insights, or whatever you want at the top of a note. You can do this yourself or use AI. 

## Zooming Out
Two types of zooming out through generalization:
1. Generalization by grouping 
2. Generalization by emergence

### Generalization By Grouping
Works by taking a series of notes with related characteristics and bringing them together. 

### Generalization By Emergence
Works by taking a series of notes and creating a new emergent idea out of them.
