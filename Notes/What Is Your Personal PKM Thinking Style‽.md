When I first got into Personal Knowledge Management, I believed everyone's notetaking style was the same.

**Because of this belief I forced a thinking style on myself FOR YEARS that wasn't natural to how I liked to think.** It was only after I took the Linking Your Thinking Workshop with Nick Milo that I made a profound realization about my notetaking thinking style. 

In this lesson we are going to explore the insight I made in that workshop so that you can identify your personal thinking style.

Don't make the same mistake I did.



One of the insights that Nick Milo emphasizes in the workshop is that just like how our health is N = 1, our PKM thinking style is N = 1.

There is no guarantee that what works for someone else will work for you. Someone might taste peanut butter and think it's bad. That someone is also likely a serial killer, but we are all individuals in our preferences for things.

**Similarly, our PKM thinking styles are personal to us as well.**

Someone might be more of a bottom-up thinker, taking isolated notes and connecting them together where, as someone else might be more of a top-down thinker, preferring to map many individual notes together. That's why learning your PKM thinking style is so essential. Mindlessly copying someone else's PKM system won't work if you don't understand how YOU think.

In the first week, we took the PKM planet survey to help us uncover what our unique PKM thinking style was.

**I was very surprised.**

## The PKM Personalities

Firstly we chose between four different PKM avatars, as you can see below.

**We were only allowed to choose one, so naturally, I went with the one that reminded me most of Gandalf, The Creative.**

While I feel I embody some aspects of all of them, the creative resonated most with me. Using my notes, I create a weekly YouTube video, blog, newsletter (you are reading right now!), two podcasts, and many shorter articles. Expressing is, in my opinion, the end goal of a PKM system because it's where you get to expose your ideas to the outside world and hopefully make a change in someone's day.

**Expression is where our efforts in developing a PKM system extend itself to the outside world.**

## I Can't Believe What I Learned Next...

The next thing I learned surprised the Kajeebus out of me.

I have a predominantly architect mode of thinking according to the survey results:

The two most common PKM personalities are architects and gardeners.

Architects like to think top-down, creating structure beforehand and adding knowledge over time. Gardeners like to think of bottom-up growing ideas over time without a pre-ordained structure. Neither personality is wrong or right. Architects like to have structure when taking notes, preferring to add ideas through MOCs or projects. In contrast, gardeners like having less structure, preferring to add ideas that resonate with them to a new note.

Maps and projects are top-down; notes are bottom-up.

For all of my time using Obsidian, I have thought of myself as a gardener. That was the main selling point of Obsidian for me. Grow notes over time by elaborating on them and connecting them so that your knowledge compounds with you over time.

**But looking at the way I take notes, this isn't the case.**

The times where I feel most enlivened by my PKM system are when I'm creating a MOC out of something. When I'm combining a collection of notes together into one greater whole. _Not when I'm connecting notes at the individual level._ Then I realized...

All of my writings are, in a way, MOCs.

**Every YouTube script, every blog post, every newsletter, every podcast is a way of assembling the various ideas I have been collecting and making a map out of them.**

Understanding this is allowing me to embrace my thinking style fully. I'm prioritizing MOCs over connecting notes on the individual level. But this doesn't mean I don't connect notes at the individual level at all.

**An important thing Nick Milo notes is that problems arise when architects or gardeners can't embody the other personality in their notetaking.**

As an architect, you must be comfortable digging deeper into your MOCs and creating notes, and as a gardener, you must be comfortable combining notes and creating MOCs. So while I'm biasing my PKM system toward MOCs, I continue to connect notes on the individual level using my conceptual notemaking method we will get to later in the course.

In this way, I have learned to find balance in my notetaking.

I don't see architects and gardeners as mutually exclusive but rather the Yin and Yang of PKM.

In the next lesson we will explore why we are using Obsidian as our tool for thought to make the transformation to the New Student Era.
