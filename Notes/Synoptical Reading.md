Adler explains that the last and most challenging reading level is Synoptical reading. It requires effective use of all three levels underneath it, meaning you shouldn't try it until you get adept at the previous levels. But synoptical reading is where the most incredible bits of insight are had. 

Essentially, synoptical reading involves analytically reading a range of information and then putting the information in conversation with another. Not literally having the information talk to each other. That would be weird.

It means comparing and contrasting the arguments of one piece of information to that of another. Most of the time this is done with a range of information on a similar topic but it can be done with information completely outside of each others subject matter.

There are a couple major questions you can ask:
- Where do the authors conflict or agree?
- How the do authors structure their points differently? 
- What is the significance of their claims? 

It's essential, however, if you want to synoptically read that you align the authors terms together. Just like in analytical reading, this means finding out what the author means by a term and finding the parallel term in the other information. 

For example, one spree of books I synoptically read was Stumbling on Happiness by Daniele Gilbert, Happy by Derren brown, The Untethered Soul by Michaele A. Singer, Awareness by Anthony De Mello, and The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle. To compare these books I had to uncover what their definition of happiness was because they were all radically different. Only than could I compare them.

This doesn't just work with books. As we will see in the Conceptual Notemaking Lesson, it applies to school classes as well. Most students treat their classes as isolated nuggets of related information.

But through putting your lecture notes and class readings in conversation with another you can build a knowledge base that grows across semesters.

You just read about the theory of all four of the levels of reading! But it's time to turn theory into action. The last module we will go through before finishing with Conceptual Notemaking are some methods for reading more effectively implementing what we talked about in the four levels of reading.
