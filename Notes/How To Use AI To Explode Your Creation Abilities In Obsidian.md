Your hobbies, skills, abilities, relationships, and so much more combine to form something no other human being has. That's what this course has been teaching. **But at the same time, knowing how to leverage AI in your notetaking can push you above and beyond the 99% of students that haven't dabbled in it whatsoever.**

In this lesson, I will show you:
- Benefits of using AI in Obsidian
- Tools for using AI in Obsidian
- Ways to use AI in Obsidian

### Benefits of Using AI In Obsidian
1.  Idea Generation and Inspiration: AI can provide fresh ideas and perspectives to stimulate your creativity. By leveraging AI algorithms, you can generate prompts, brainstorm new concepts, and explore connections between different ideas, sparking inspiration and expanding your creative horizons.
2.  Grammar and Style Improvement: AI can assist in refining your writing by offering grammar and style suggestions. Whether it's checking for spelling errors, recommending sentence improvements, or suggesting alternative word choices, AI can help you polish your content and ensure clarity and professionalism.
3.  Content Expansion and Generation: AI tools can generate content based on existing text or prompts. This capability can be particularly useful when you're facing writer's block or need to create variations of your existing work. AI-generated content can serve as a starting point or a source of inspiration for further development.
4.  Intelligent Recommendations: AI algorithms can analyze your note-taking patterns and preferences to provide personalized recommendations. These recommendations can include related notes, relevant resources, or even suggested connections between different concepts, helping you discover new insights and deepen your understanding.
5.  Time Savings and Efficiency: By automating certain tasks, such as note organization or grammar checking, AI can save you time and streamline your creative process. This allows you to focus more on the actual content creation and idea generation, maximizing your productivity and output.
6.  Collaboration and Feedback: AI can facilitate collaboration by suggesting potential collaborators based on your interests and areas of expertise. Additionally, AI-powered feedback systems can provide constructive suggestions on your work, helping you refine and improve your creative output.

### AI Tools You Can Use With Obsidian
John and I have tested many different AI tools outside and inside Obsidian and right now our number one favorite to this day remains gold ol' ChatGPT.

You can use ChatGPT by making a free OpenAI account on https://chat.openai.com/. 

However if you want to use AI in Obsidian some plug ins have come out recently:
- Quick add (this plug in is already in the vault but can be changed to integrate AI)
- Text generator 
- AVA AI

## Ways to Use AI In Obsidian
### **Summarize Information** 
AI can save you from drowning in a sea of text by condensing lengthy articles or notes into bite-sized summaries. 

One of my favorite ways to use this is to summarize my highlights for books, articles, and other pieces of information to prime me before I create more extensive notes for it.

### Simplify Information
AI can be your cheat code for understanding complex concepts. 

It takes convoluted information and transforms it into easy-to-digest nuggets of knowledge. You know that Professor that is awful at explaining hard concepts? An AI-powered tool can simplify a dense academic paper on game theory, making it more accessible and user-friendly.

### Outline Information for a Essay
AI can be your quest log for organizing ideas and structuring your essay.

It helps you create a roadmap, guiding you through different sections and ensuring a coherent flow. Often times before going through the dump, lump, jump process of creating something mentioned in the previous lesson, I will ask ChatGPT to help me come up with an outline for my creation by describing what I'm trying to create. Alternatively I can feed it the outline I create after going through the lump stage and it can fill in any holes I haven't answered.

### Brainstorm Title Ideas
AI can be your creative muse, assisting you in generating captivating titles for your essay or other creation. 

It throws out a plethora of catchy and attention-grabbing options, making you feel like a master title ninja. It's like discovering a hidden treasure chest filled with legendary title scrolls.

### Edit and Proofread Writing 
Goodbye manual proofreading!

Simply feed your writing into ChaGPT, Grammarly premium or some other AI tool, and you can save yourself hours of work proofreading and revising yourself.

### Rephrase Writing in a New Voice
AI can be your shapeshifter, transforming your writing style to match different tones or voices. 

With AI, you can effortlessly switch between a casual, conversational tone or a formal, scholarly voice, depending on the context. Or you can ask it to talk in the tone of Bart Simpson. I'm weird I know.

### Help You Do Conceptual Notemaking 
While doing conceptual notemaking you can ask AI to help you answer any of the four Gs of notemaking if you are really struggling.

Additionally, you can ask it to come up with examples for your concept notes.

### Find Counterarguments And Areas for Improvement In Your Writing
Many times after writing an essay inside of Obsidian, I will feed it into ChatGPT and ask two questions:
1. What are some counterarguments to what I'm arguing?
2. Where are the areas for improvement in this writing?

It's incredible how AI can give you an ouside perspective. Gone are the days where you NEED someone else to read your writing to get feedback.

### AI Enhances Your Thinking, It Doesn't Replace it
If you use AI to do the things mentioned above, you can explode your creation abiltities in Obsidian. 

**But remember, AI enhances your thinking, it doesn't replace it.** 

Don't fall into the trap of thinking you can write something with ChatGPT and call it a day. As of right now, ChatGPT is better as a braintstorming, rough drafting, and research tool than it is a replacement of you.

**The most important skill students need to build in the next decade is how to think better, so they can _do_ more effectively with AI.**

ChatGPT has the capability of becoming a student's greatest Digital Intern. But the quality of ChatGPTs outputs reflect the quality of its inputs. If you don't think well, ChatGPT won't respond well to your thoughts.

**Student's that learn to build the skill of thinking in college instead of mindless doing will succeed.**
