Your collect toolkit is the specific sources you prioritize collecting information from in your second brain. I find choosing three main information mediums and sticking primarily to those is a good number.

The most common information mediums for you will probably be lectures, textbooks, e-books, online articles, paper books, anime, YouTube videos, and pdfs. I consume mostly lecture content, textbooks, ebooks, articles, and podcasts.

One app which I recommend everyone adds to their toolkit is Readwise. Readwise collects highlights and annotations from your mediums of consumption and sends them seamlessly to your notetaking app of choice. I can't describe how much easier this makes collecting information. Obsidian has a fantastic plug in integration with Readwise that makes collecting highlights seamless.
