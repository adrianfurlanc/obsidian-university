In the digital age we are living inside of a paradox of abundance. The quality of good information is only getting better while the quality of bad information is only getting worse. But the abundance of bad information is going up faster.

**Inspectional reading allows us to through the bullshaggery and find true insight.**

It's especially useful for one major thing in school, figuring out which of the readings are important. Professors often assign way too much reading for you to reasonably do in a week. In fact, I theorize they sometimes don't even know what they're assigning. They haven't read it themselves in ages! You can use inspectional reading to figure out what you should read and what you shouldn't.

There are two levels to inspectional reading:
1. Pre-reading 
2. Superficial Reading

### Pre-reading
The first level of inspectional reading is pre-reading. At this level, the main goal is to learn if the piece of information is of worth to you.

Much of this is a subjective process. One of the best tools you can use is something that will be brought back in the next lesson on Conceptual Notemaking which is USE. While reading skip any information which is USE, Unimportant, Self Explanatory, or Easy enough to memorize on the spot. You don't have to read this information.

This systematic skimming can be done in a variety of ways. First, look at the title page and if the book has one its preface. Study the table of contents and try to understand the book's general structure. Check the index if the book has one to quickly estimate the range of topics that the book will talk about. Finally, look at the chapters that seem pivotal to the book's argument or analysis, and pre-read the first couple sentences, last couple sentences, or whichever paragraph's and sentences catch your eye.

The point is not to read the entire book but to **get a general sense of the quality of the information and flow of the argument.** 

### Superficial Reading
Adler explains that the second level of inspectional reading is superficial reading. Superficial reading is the art of reading at different speeds based on the text. 

It's different from pre-reading in that you usually do it after you have decided you will consume a piece of information. The reason it works is because **different pieces of information should be read differently.** Even the same piece of information should be read differently by different people based on the past knowledge they bring to the text.

Reading a short and deep poem on the wonders of peanut butter should not be read in the same way as a self help book like Atomic Habits. You don't eat a rich cr√®me brule the same way you eat French fries do you?

In the same vein, most books or pieces of information contains sections of material that can and should be read very quickly. They also, however, contain information that should be read slowly and contemplated on. 

How can you tell what should be read actively versus what should be read more superficially? 

Usually, it's pretty obvious. First, read more carefully the stuff that resonates with you. That makes your heart beat faster, your pupils dilate, the room shudder. Second, read more carefully what confuses you. If it confuses you you obviously need to give it some more time. Finally, read more carefully things that the Professor deems more important. If it is likely an essential part of the class, it's worth reading more tightly.

The level of depth you will get with superficial reading, however, will never read reach that of [[Analytical Reading]].
