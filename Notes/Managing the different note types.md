Now we are going to learn how to customize Obsidian for School!

## Viewing
Not all information should be captured and treated equally, so that's why the vault contains lots of different notes with their own structure and use cases ü§©

Each note type will have their own place to view notes, denoted with "My" then the type of note.

Each one of these notes has a `#üîç` tag since they help you view and search for that kind of note.

All the current note types can be found in [[üè† My Home]] which serves as your dashboard for all the notes that you taking for school. The note types themselves and their use cases are explained in [[Note Explanations]].

Depending on the type of note, you may see things based on status ([[My Lectures]]), or by relevant [[Metadata]] 
## Creating
For each note, there will be a button to create a new note of that kind using a button in the "My" note associated with it, which may look like this:
```button
name QuickAdd: Create Input Note
type command
action QuickAdd: Create Input Note
```
^button-dxz7

 but you can also just use the [[QuickAdd Plugin]] choice palette to create them instead

## Connecting
Once you make the note, you then need to fill out the [[Metadata#Inline Metadata Fields]] to help with proper sorting and viewing in [[Dataview Plugin#Types|queries]].

If you look at [[Psychology 100]], an example note for a specific course, I set the year and semester to match the configuration in the [[My Courses#Current Courses]]  query (year 1 and semester 1), which lets me see it there.

Now, to populate the units, assignments, and lectures fields related to the course,  the `Course::` field of these notes should contain a link to the course note (see [[Research paper on an important figure]])
