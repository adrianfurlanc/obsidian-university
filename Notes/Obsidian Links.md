You know how you can jump around from page to page by clicking on highlighted words in Wikipedia?

By using Obsidian links, you can connect your notes the same way.

Links are a powerful way to connect and organize your information beyond traditional tags and folder structures.

You can have ideas connected with multiple notes at the same time, unlike how you can only have a note in one folder at a time.

Just like how our brain remembers things by forming new connections between neurons, you can increase the amount of connections in your notes and ideas.

You get to retain your trains of thought through the paths created by your links.

Instead of trying to figure out what folder you put a note in, you can go to a related note and naturally find it by following the path your previous self created.

Your notes ultimately become a representation of your learning journey ðŸ¤¯

## Creating Links
Watch my video on how to start creating your [first link](https://youtu.be/jAPn6yqrDxQ?t=303)

Typing `[[]]` around the title of a note will create a link to it:
[[Example Note]]

If you want to link to a certain **header** of a note, you can put a `#` after the note name:
[[Example Note#Example Header]]

If you want to link to a certain **section** of a note, you can select the text, right click, and choose `Copy link to block`:
[[Example Note#^pthwkz]]

But sometimes you might be too lazy and will want to see the contents of the note without clicking inside, like if you wanted to show a quote from a different note, so you can add a `!` before the link to view it
![[Example Note#Example Header]]

Later on, we'll show you how to [[Module - Connect|connect]] notes using [[Conceptual Notemaking]]
## Viewing Links
### Graph View
The graph view helps you visually see the connections between your notes, with more connected ones being larger.
```button
name Graph view: Open graph view
type command
action Graph view: Open graph view
```
^button-7rj3

The local graph view only shows connections for the note you're currently viewing.
```button
name Graph view: Open local graph
type command
action Graph view: Open local graph
```
^button-bfer

You can also consider changing the depth at which notes are registered, which can let you also see notes linked to the linked notes of the original note

### Types of Links
**Backlinks are links from other notes that link to the current note you're in.

Looking at the backlinks pane:
```button
name Backlinks: Show backlinks
type command
action Backlinks: Show backlinks
```
^button-475i

I (John) like to use a more enhanced way to view links using the [[Strange New Worlds Plugin]]

Outgoing links are the links inside the current note, which you can view in the pane:
```button
name Outgoing Links: Show outgoing links
type command
action Outgoing Links: Show outgoing links
```
^button-socv
