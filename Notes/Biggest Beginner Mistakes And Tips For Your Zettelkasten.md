## 3 Biggest Mistakes Students Make Starting an Obsidian Zettelkasten in College

There are a lot of beginner mistakes to starting an Obsidian Zettelkasten in college.

Out of all of them, however, these are the three biggest traps:

- Not connecting notes between classes and semesters together
- Not connecting your class notes to your own learnings
- Not creating MOCs out of your class notes

### 1. Not Connecting Notes Between Classes And Semesters Together

When first creating a Zettelkasten, it can be easy for students to fall back into the sequential notetaking style they are so used to from more traditional notetaking methods.

But the power of a Zettelkasten comes in the connection between seemingly unrelated ideas. For example, connecting a note from Introductory Biology about recessive genes to your History note on the massive chins of the Old English Aristocracy caused by incest. You have to make sure that you connect notes between classes and semesters together.

To remind myself of this, I reflect on this quote regularly:

**"There are no rigid disciplines in the universe, only concepts."**

All disciplines — Biology, Neuroanatomy, Behavioral Statistics, American History, etc. — are just highly related concepts linked together into a coherent and more easily digestible form. It's through the linking of these highly related concepts, from class to class from semester to semester, that your knowledge base starts to grow. Your Zettelkasten becomes more than the sum of its individual parts.

**Your knowledge compounds over time.**

### 2. Not Connecting Your Class Notes To Your Own Learnings

Many beginner Zettelkasteners — it's a word now I made it up — think their learnings inside class are separate from their learnings outside class.

As a result, they separate their class notes in Obsidian from their notes on Podcasts, books, blog posts, and more. But as said earlier, the power in a Zettelkasten comes from connecting ideas together and scaling them over time. Your personal learnings can only help in this process.

In fact, it will likely only make you more interested in your learnings inside of class.

Double Whammy!

### 3. Not Creating MOCs Out Of Your Class Notes

As your Zettelkasten grows throughout the semester, your class notes will soon start to become overwhelming.

Some notes are connected to other notes, but there is no clear map for the class. The mistake is to leave them floating in the depths of the nether realm. This will only guarantee you never touch them again and don't form an accurate mental model of the class.

The solution is to create the Maps of Content (MOCs) out of your class notes.

There are many, many more beginner mistakes to starting a Obsidian Zettelkasten in College. But avoid these ones, and you will stay away from the worst of the traps.

## 6 Tips For Maintaining a Healthy and Sustainable Zettelkasten Practice

1. **Make Growing Your Zettelkasten a Habit:** One of the highest leverage habits I instilled to work on my Zettelkasten was to make it a daily quest to process and grow my notes for 15 minutes a day. I usually do this in the morning. This 15 minute doesn't seem long, but over the long run, it compounds to insane degrees.
2. **Have Some Fun With It:** Growing a Zettelkasten is going to be hard at first. It goes against the Cookie Cutter way we have been taught to take notes since we were a kid. So enjoy the journey of learning.
3. **Epic Efforts Over Projects:** It's not about the number of notes you collect but the quality of the loot you find! Focus on the journey of crafting high-quality, powerful notes that capture the essence of an idea.
4. **Reflect, Respawn, and Respec:** Take time to reflect on your Zettelkasten journey. Just like in a video game, evaluate your skills, techniques, and workflows. Experiment with different strategies, re-spec your note-taking approach and level up your Zettelkasten game. Don't assume the way I grow my Zettelkasten is automatically the best way.
5. **Beware Of The Collectors Fallacy:** one of the most common traps students fall for when building a Zettelkasten as they collect too much information into their system without using it for anything. You can avoid this not only by collecting less things but having a bias for creation.
6. **Take notes on one area of interest and start from there.** On the other end of the spectrum, a common problem is students don't know where to start taking notes. In this case, I recommend you choose one area of interest from looking at previous things you have consumed and start there.

## The Zettelkasten Transformation

**If you implement the workflow and mindset of the zettelkasten for at least two years, I promise your life will change dramatically.**

Why two years? There's no magical reason. Following through with anything for more than two years is bound to show results of some kind.

I doubt you will be disappointed if you do.

**You will start to see ideas as an interconnected network and conversation between different people, a conversation you can join at any place, wherever your interests lie.**

Over time everything will start to make sense, as you can see mapped notes, projects, and new ideas forming under the structure of your everyday life. Your mind will change, learning to work symbiotically with your second brain to draw on resources, references, and research far beyond what it can remember on its own. You become more objective and unattached, knowing if an idea doesn't work out, you have a treasure trove of others ready to go. Your zettelkasten becomes an externalization of your psychology, a mirror reflecting who you think you are, who you want to be, and who you want to become.

**Because you have a PKM workflow, every experience becomes an opportunity to learn and grow.**

People will notice.

They'll see you can draw an unusually large body of knowledge at a moment's notice without realizing you never set purposeful time to remember anything. They will admire the fluidity and interestingness of your ideas without realizing your zettelkasten makes them come organically. They'll respect your avid expression without realizing it's so much easier when you never have to start from scratch again. They will see the genuine joy and curiosity you show toward everything in life. Then they will become curious about what you are doing differently. Finally, they will make their own PKM journeys.

**In this way, PKM is not only the art of changing your relationship to information but changing others as well.**
