Having a daily note helps you plan, journal, and reflect on your studying progress and accomplishments, which can be used as data or food for thought to analyze and reflect upon in your weekly reviews.

**To implement periodic reviews into your school life, I would recommend you find a regular time during the day and a day during the week to do your daily and weekly reviews.** 

Right now the templates used for periodic reviews are very basic and contains the bare minimum (or at least in comparison to my [personal ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUmOKkJq8xw)), but you can always customize it and make it a cruicial part of your personal life management.

Since this is a school and studying vault though, I've kept the prompts and sections related to school üòÅ

To create your own periodic notes, you can use the [[Calendar Plugin]] pane on the right sidebar.

To understand how to use the periodic notes, see [[Note Explanations#Daily Note Template]] and [[Note Explanations#Weekly Review Template]]
## Examples
