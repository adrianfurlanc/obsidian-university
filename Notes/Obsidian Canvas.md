## Uses
### Visual concept mapping
Obsidian canvas is the best way to visually connect your notes beyond the limitations of text files.

It gives you a new dimension at which you can explore the ideas in your classes.

You can draw arrow relationships to different concepts in different notes, embed the contents of your notes, the limit is genuinely your imagination.
### Dashboards
But beyond that, you can also use it as a dashboard to see different types of notes to set up different workflows, as seen by [[Note-Making Station.canvas|Note-Making Station]]
