**Creation is all that matters.**

The collecting and connecting you have done in the previous modules means nothing without creation. Creation is where you put knowledge into action. It's where you put your learning to action.

**There is no faster way to learn than applying new knowledge.**

But there's another reason creation is incredible. 

It allows you to compound your knowledge. Your past self forms the building blocks of future work. 

**Your unique knowledge base compounds over time.**

It doesn't matter if you don't want to be a content creator, creating things as a student is the fastest way to learn and benefit from the compounding effect.

The first thing you will learn is the three step process I use to create any writing related product. 

You read that right.

I use these three steps to create anything writing related.

Learn how by checking out the first lesson in [[Module - Create]].
