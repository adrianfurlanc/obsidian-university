[[Conceptual Notemaking]] is a form [[Notemaking]]--a term coined by fellow PKMer [Nick Milo](https://www.youtube.com/@linkingyourthinking)--which involves taking notes in ones own words. It uses concepts as the fundamental unit of knowledge management. Instead of notetaking predominantly through sequential format on exactly what the professor says, you take notes on individual concepts and *link them together.*
