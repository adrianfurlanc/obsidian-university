College education is forever changing with the release of large language models like ChatGPT.

To enter the new student era, you must learn to change alongside it. I believe you should use Large Language Models like your own personal R2D2s in the rising age of AI. If you don't, you will fall into behind into the dust. Luckily, according to a 2023 survey by Pews Research, 58% of American's have heard of ChatGPT but only 14% have tried it and only 2% have found it extremely useful in their life. 

**So if you are even beginning to think about it, you are ahead of the pack.** 

While I will focus on ChatGPTs effect in particular on College students in this lesson, the things I talk about are applicable to everyone evaluating their relationship with the tool.
That's why we must discuss:
-   The Applications Of ChatGPT For College Learning, Notetaking, and Studying
-   The Problems Of ChatGPT
-   The Implications Of ChatGPT On The Future Of College

## The Applications Of ChatGPT For College Learning, Notetaking, and Studying
A couple of months ago, I started playing with ChatGPT just for fun.

As you know, I'm an avid YouTuber and blogger and wanted to see what it was capable of. Through my journey, I realized it you can apply it as a student in four main ways:
1.  Research
2.  Writing
	- Summarize information
	- Outline information 
	- Act as a copy editor
	- Create audio transcription notes
	- Rephrasing writing
	- Email writing
	- Notemake
3.  Homework help
4.  Study aid

This section will focus mainly on the positive applications and get to the problems later.

### **1. Research**

As you know, ChatGPT is an incredible research tool.

One of my favorite research endeavors I have been using it for recently is to help me copywrite and create email automation sequences using ConvertKit. I asked it the question:

> What are some of the best podcasts, books, articles, and thought leaders on copywriting?

It gave me a list just like that.

**It saved me hours worth of time I would have had to research independently.**

This is invaluable not just for personal content creation projects but for student essays as well.

While researching an essay showing the causes, effects, and solutions of video game addiction, I asked ChatGPT to give me a source supporting my point, a direct quote, and a statistic. Of course, I fact checked the point it gave me, but it was truly jaw-dropping how specific it was able to get with the answer.

**Give it a well-worded input, and you will get a insightful output.**

### **2. Writing**

In the writing sphere, students and authors are using it to write nonfiction and fiction.

Nassam Osman, a nonfiction writer, says it usually takes him 3-6 months to write a book. However, using ChatGPT he went meta and used it to write the aptly named book how to write a book with ChatGPT.

**With its help he was able to write the book in one week rather than 3-6 months.**

You can use ChatGPT not only to write faster but better as well.

With ChatGPTs help I wrote a fiction romance between Dwane The Rock Johnson and Harry Potter, who team up to defeat Darth Vader. Copies will be available at the bottom of the page (I'm just kidding lol). During the writing process, ChatGPT gave me tips on characters, plot, setting, finding my voice, and more.

**Don't be surprised when Aidan Helfant becomes the next fiction romance household name.**

There are tons of other ways AI can be used inside of our notetaking for school which we will get to later in the course when we dive into the 3Cs of knoweldge management, Collecting, Connecting, and Creating. 

### **3. Homework Help**

Another thing I have heard many students are using it for is homework help.

Some of my computer science friends use it to check their code for coding class. Others use it to check their math problems. And others use it to do their homework for them...

I wouldn't recommend this last course of action, but with a tool as powerful as ChatGPT you can't be surprised.

### **4. Study Aid**

ChatGPT can literally create an entire test for you.

Give it a prompt like, I'm studying for an introductory Psychology class, give me 20 multiple choice questions with five options and test me. It will generate a test on the spot. Let that sink in.

Students without access to tutors are no longer nearly as burdened.

## **Problems Of ChatGPT**

Unfortunately, it's not all sunshine and butterflies.

ChatGPT has a few prominent problems that you NEED to know about to be a respectable college student:

1.  It's Limited In Critical Thinking Skills and Overly Moral and Unbiased Language
2.  It Makes Stuff Up
3.  It Exasperates The Problems Already Present In Humans

### **1. It's Limited In Critical Thinking Skills and Overly Moral and Unbiased Language**

Large Language Models deepest flaw is their inability to think critically about what they are saying.

Noam Chomsky says in his 2023 article The False Promise of ChatGPT, "ChatGPT and similar programs are, by design, unlimited in what they can "learn" (which is to say, memorize); they are incapable of distinguishing the possible from the impossible." The human mind is not like ChatGPT, a lumbering statistical engine. We critically think about what we say rather than extrapolate the most likely conversational response or most probable answer to a scientific question. Chomsky furthers that "Whereas humans are limited in the kinds of explanations we can rationally conjecture, machine learning systems can learn both that the earth is flat and that the earth is round. They trade merely in probabilities that change over time."

**Those are the ingredients of explanation, the mark of true intelligence.**

In addition, Large Language Models are limited by overly moral and unbiased language.

ChatGPT and many other large language models are coded not to say anything overly controversial. It's creators don't want to receive backlash for it saying something racist or immoral. However, this poses significant constraints on its ability to help create new knowledge because knowledge outside the scientific consensus almost always sounds ridiculous until further evidence is given. For example, the theory of Evolution was seen as blubberflush and still is by many today despite the mountain of evidence supporting it. But because Charles Darwin was okay with pushing against the backlash, the evidence continued to stack up and up and more and more people rallied in support of it.

**But because ChatGPT and other large language models aren't capable of this, they will have limited use cases in creating new knowledge.**

### **2. It Makes Stuff Up**

ChatGPT is known to make up sources.

I was asking it to show me evidence that some game-related skills don't translate to real life. It gave me some sources! But when I fact-checked them, they linked to some articles from the journal Science on recessive genes in Papayas.

Not at all what I was asking for.

This is why you must always fact check to ensure ChatGPT is giving you valid and reliable information.

ChatGPT loses validity and use the more in depth a topic you go.

The more in-depth you go, the more likely it is to make stuff up and struggle with the nuance of your research topic. It doesn't have the same care for words as a human academic does. As a result, it can use it in a way that confuses the questioner.

**It should remain a tool for brainstorming and learning the general idea of a topic..**

### **3. It Exasperates The Problems Already Present In Humans**

ChatGPT is exasperating the problems already present in humans.

It's trained on a massive corpus of human knowledge from the internet. **But the internet isn't a valid source.** In essence, asking it a question is a great way to find the general internets opinion on a topic, not the nuanced view.

Because its sources are biased, it's biased.

**This is why it's so important to understand the problems with ChatGPT.**

More people have the ability to ask it questions without a critical understanding of its problems and spread it without fact-checking. This creates more misinformation , unintentionally spread incorrect information, or it's worse evil brother disinformation, intentionally spread incorrect information.

Understanding it's applications and problems can help protect you against this.

## **Implications For The Future of College Education**

College is forever changing with the release of ChatGPT.

I recently attended a webinar by Dickie Bush and Nicolas Cole on how ChatGPT is changing the field Digital Writing. This webinar showed me there are many important implications it has on the college experience. Those who understand how it will rise to the top, and those who don't will fall to the bottom.

Here are the three implications I believe it has on the college experience:
1.  It's Creating A Paradox of Abundance
2.  It's Making Student's Ask Whether They Are Going To Stay Doers Or Become Thinkers
3.  It's Making Student's Perspective The Most Important Thing About Them

### **1. It's Creating A Paradox of Abundance**

ChatGPT is creating a paradox of abundance in college.

The quantity of bad information is getting higher as students can use it to write essays, do homework, and answer problems without any input on their end. However, the quality of good information is also increasing as students who know how to think are using it to bolster their student work rather than replace it.

**In effect, the quality of student work is getting higher while at the same time, the quantity of bad student work is getting higher, creating a paradox of abundance.**

### **2. It's Making Student's Ask Whether They Are Going To Stay Doers Or Become Thinkers**

Traditional schooling makes students into doers.

It's built on the premise of preparing student's for factory jobs from the industrial revolution; turning them into cookie cutter students. But with ChatGPT, the "doing" part of many student tasks is being automated. The unique asset student's bring to the table is thinking.

**The most important skill students need to build in the next decade is how to think better, so they can _do_ more effectively with AI.**

ChatGPT has the capability of becoming a student's greatest Digital Intern. But the quality of ChatGPTs outputs reflect the quality of its inputs. If you don't think well, ChatGPT won't respond well to your thoughts.

**Student's that learn to build the skill of thinking in college instead of mindless doing will succeed.**

### **3. It's Making Student's Perspective The Most Important Thing About Them**

Many student's are scared ChatGPT will replace the need for their input.

In reality, it's only making the unique perspective each student brings to a subject *more important.* Every person has an incredible diversity of knowledge, skills, and abilities. If they can learn to bring this perspective to their class learnings using ChatGPT as their doer, they can revolutionize their field.

The age of the cookie cutter student, the student who copies what the professor says verbatim and doesn't think about their learnings, is over.

That's why once we get to the modules later on in the course on connecting and creating I will be showcasing how you can use AI to its full potential while connecting and creating inside of your notes. 

It's essential that we discuss it now so that you understand the importance of breaking out of the cookie cutter mindset and becoming a unique student in school.

### 4. Building A Second Brain Is More Important Than Ever Before
Building a second brain, the external, centralized, digital repositories for the things you learn and the resources from which they come is more important than ever. 

Your second brain provides the ammunition that AI needs to create personalized valuable information for you. 

**Students that learn to effectively manage their digital lives, like through creating digital notes in Obsidian, will build the critical information they can use to fuel the prompts they give AI.**
