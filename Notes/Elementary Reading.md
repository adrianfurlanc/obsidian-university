Elementary reading is the reading most of us learn in elementary school. By mastering this level, one goes from nonliterary to beginning literacy.

You learn the alphabet, foster initial reading skills, and figure out what is said in a passage. In elementary reading you simply read an author's words as they are. This approach is very common when you are first coming at a text.

However, elementary readers cannot form deeper relations with the text. While they might understand what occurs in a particular passage, they struggle to create a cohesive narrative out of multiple sections and develop no deeper relationship with the books they read. 

To elementary readers, books are books. They aren't capable of taking away profound lessons and introspections as they don't even know the process of doing so.

A great reader should be spending their time at this level very rarely. The next level, [[Inspectional Reading]], is where the true value of the four levels starts to come into play.
