Summary:: View and create daily or weekly notes

If you look in the bottom right of the sidebar, there's an interactive calendar you can use to manage periodic notes.

```button
type command
name Calendar: Open view
action Calendar: Open view
```
^button-5zd8

Click on a date, and you'll open the note of that day.

Click on a week number in the left hand side, and you'll open the weekly note of the day.

For a given week, the adjacent Monday, all the way until the next Sunday, will count as that week. (ex. 2023-W08 would be from the 20th to the 26th)

The dots represent the amount of words inside (each filled dot is 500 words), which can be customized in the settings.

Just play around with clicking different days a bit!

Once you have finished with the action items move onto the next lesson in [[Module - The Seven Obsidian Plug Ins That Will Explode Your Notetaking]].
