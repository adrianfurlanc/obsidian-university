*You can watch the video version of this lesson and the four reading levels up above.*

A few months ago I was sitting in my living room enjoying a nice hot cup of chamomile tea while reading Make It Stick. My mom walked in to say hi.

"What are you reading?"

"Make it Stick by Mortimer J. Adler. It's a book about how to retain things in memory. Spaced repetition, active recall, the testing effect. All that jazz."

My mom put her finger on her chin and began thinking for five seconds.

"What's the matter?"

"I'm trying to remember if I read that book or not."

**I'm trying to remember if I read that book or not...** 

Unfortunately, the position my mom was in is hardly unique. We all have had experiences reading something and not remembering it even just a few days later. While some of this is just the nature of the silly sponge in our head, a lot of it has to do with the fact that we have been reading wrong our entire lives.

I'm going to give you a little secret to save hours every week in your classwork: **don't do all the readings.** If you did all the readings in every one of your classes you likely wouldn't have time for anything else. Not all the readings are important. You need to learn to sift through the mud to find the peanut butter underneath. 

This applies not only to school readings but your information consumption outside of class as well. Collecting effectively is a skill. The better the initial quality of your collecting, the better connecting and finally creating will come down the line. 

In this lesson we are going to explore the insights from Mortimer J. Adler's aptly named book, How to Read a Book. Adler separates reading into four discrete levels each with their mindset. As we go through each of the four levels I will add in relevant outside collection advice from other courses I have taken. 

The first level is [[Elementary Reading]].
