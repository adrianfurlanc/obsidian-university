If you're coming from Notion, you may find it more convenient to use user interfaces to perform certain actions.

But I (John) personally think hotkeys are the secret formula to **write at the speed of thought.**

Instead of having to continuously move your mouse across the screen, you have access to almost all features of the vault with mere keystrokes.

You can reach a point of instantly creating a new lecture note, adding bullet points, moving sections, opening new tabs, and viewing related links, just by using your keyboard.

It's a lot to learn, but whenever you try to do something in the vault, I would suggest seeing if there is a hotkey you can use instead. You can come back to this note as a reference for a potential hot key to change it to.

## Hotkeys
Some of my mappings are weird, so change them to what makes most sense for you!
