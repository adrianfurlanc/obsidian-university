If you want to learn more about any of these notes, you can go to the community plugins page, search them, up, and then read their descriptions.

None of these are enabled, so you would have to manually install them on your own.
## Features
### Media Extended
If your lectures are YouTube videos, you can use this plugin to watch videos within Obsidian, making timestamps in your note with a simple hotkey press.
### Focus Mode
If you're wanting to get into a deep writing session and find the user interfaces distracting, you can toggle on focus mode to hide it all and only see your tabs open.
## Notes
### Imgur Plugin
Imgur plug makes it so that when you upload images to your vault they are uploaded to the web on Imgur and added to Obsidian using a link. This makes it so that if you copy and paste your Obsidian images somewhere else the images still show.
### Note Refactor
If you want to easily create conceptual notes, you can use the Note refractor to create new notes with highlighted content incredibly quickly.
### Excalidraw
Excalidraw is a visual diagram software you can use to make visuals in your Obsidian vault.

## Specific Use Cases
### Quick LaTeX for Obsidian
LaTeX is already supported in Obsidian, but if you're planning on using it, this plugin gives shortcuts and autocomples syntax to help you write faster ðŸ˜Ž
### Zotero Integration
If you write heavily cited papers, then you can integrate Obsidian to easily manage your sources library as well.
